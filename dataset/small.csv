"Operation Playmate.com -- did anyone hear about this in on O'Rielly Factor? Apparently Playboy Playmates are sending the troops pics, autographs etc etc *I guess it's good that Rick and Greg got out before they could log on right?!*"
"So im back from Arizona now and its 11 but it feels like 9 to me, so im not too tired. Cait went home a few hours ago and im alone for the first time in...a while. which is good and bad. Caitlin and i had some fun adventures with the creepy bugs and the trip to the observatory and the fireworks and the george forman grill and the many many moives and bond wars and... i dunno. fun stuff. I like Caitlin. She's a cool kid. But its been a while since i felt so much like i had a best friend...and i wasn't with her. if that makes any sense. which it might not. and i dont mean that i wasnt having fun with caitlin, cause i definitely was. but... i dunno, certain things... its....really hard to explain. i dont just mean that i was missing emily. i mean...i would just feel sometimes that, although i love Caitlin and we're close friends, its not the same. Wow, tahts a horrible explanation. sorry. suffice to say it hammered in the notion that Emily is my best friend. I don't/didn't like to think about her that way... cause... im not her best friend. im  one  of her best friends. so shes just...Emily. And that means a hell of a lot of things as opposed to \"best friend\" which only means one...so its a more suitible title, right? I dunno. but anyone who knows me well will understand... i have an Emily. are we best friends? well, lets not bother with all that. she's Emily. 'nuff said. and i used to think about it like that all the time. not that i would ever call you a liar if you said she was my best friend, but i...didnt like to htink about it like that. i guess. i dunno. But this trip... i dunno, it seems so much more apparent that i have a best friend. maybe Emily doesnt have  a  best friend, but i do. and... i dunno, it just seems easier to think about our friendship now in comparison to my friendships with other people...like...now its not so weird to say best friend, whearas before...well, she kind of had her own category or something. and i guess she still does. im not gonna go shouting to all the world \"Emily's my best friend!\" but... i dunno. just...somehow... im thinking about it differently now.  aaaaaaaaand... i was good until Tuesday. but i dont really want to talk about that here.  i dunno what to say about my trip.  my brothers annoyed me. a lot.  i really dont want to go to fencing.  i really want to see Emily tommorrow or wednesday and get on with our crazy fun summer.  cant wait to go to church. ;-)  I love Caitlin in such a different way than i love Emily. Or anyone, for that matter. I dont think you really love people more or less than other people...just...differently. but there can be quite a difference.  I love looking up at the stars. I should really get to that poem...  I hope she comes next summer."
"I grabbed the mail today on my way in from work, and in it was a letter addressed to me. The sender was \"Saccomanno\" and had Doerre's address as the return address. But the strangest part was, it was all in my own handwriting... It dawned on me that this was a letter I had written to Mrs. Saccomanno, my english teacher in 8th grade. I remembered that we had to write a letter to her as if we had just graduated high school and were looking back. I read it, with great expectations of funny predictions that were in no way plausible, but it turned out I just told about what happened to all of my friends. I don't know why. But here is my 8th grade \"just graduated high school\" letter:  \"Dear Mrs. Saccomanno,       Thank you for helping me be a better person. Paul and I haven't gotten in trouble even once for zinging erasers down the chalkboard tray. Thanks for helping me maintain discipline.      Brad Dodson has sold over one million dollars in software. I don't know what it does yet, though. Jeff Easley didn't follow his dreams, which is what he told me to do, and is now working as a part-time janitor at Klein Oak. K.C. Adams partied all during high school and is now a hippie roaming the country promoting peace. Paul Janus is graduating as valedictorian, and was voted \"Most Successful.\" I got a 1600 on my SAT, and am accepted to LSU, where Amanda Vatne is going also. Her and I have been going out since our sophomore year, when she finally realized my potential. Raj Atri made a new cologne based on himself, and it is still the best-selling cologne in the history of the world. He was also voted \"Most Likely to Find a Potato that Resembles Himself.\" Nolan Blue opened a shop that sells mysterious items for various reasons. He runs it part-time after school. Mo Wu and Richard MacNguyen started a band that promotes free love and drugs. Richard has an addiction to crack, but has fought against it, and hasn't touched any since 2003.      After LSU, I hope to be an artist or a pro sports player. I'm not sure whether I'll pursue hockey or baseball. Amanda and I have been wanting to get married, and after we do, we might visit with Mo and Emily Hatcher.      Anyway, thanks for everything, and maybe I'll come back and visit at Doerre. Maybe...                                                Your best student,                                               Sean Murphy  P.S. I forgot to tell you that I was  president of NHS, and was voted for having \"Best Attitude Toward Life.\" Thanks again for influencing me. \"  Wow. I was a weirdo for thinking up that stuff. And *psh* Amanda Vatne? I'm way out of her league. Ha ha ha ha. I still manage to crack myself up, though.  This was the highlight of my day (other than the boss not being at work) so I'll just log off now.  I want comments on here if you got your letters, too.  God bless"
"Well, I just wrapped up my 4-H trip of the summer, the Tubing Rally. It was great fun, the skit was so awesome, and I set a new dance trend. LOL I'm rather sad, as the Tubing Rally marks the last event of the 4-H summer season, and it's on to the fall, the Fair, and the harvest! However, it does mean the start of a new 4-H year. So I have a whole new year ahead of me on board and such. 'Reflective Mode Off' - I am going to start excercising. I've got the thin thing down, now I just need some definition fo' sheezy. Since I need to start getting up early and get into the whole swing of things in terms of time cycles for school, I may take some of that extra time and take up jogging. Then I'm going to do drylands from the swim team. Oh, yeah. Grebel. - Well, I have 11 days until school begins. Time to finish Sophie's World and that textbook work! I'm glad I did all my school supply shopping earlier this month. Now all I need is a haircut and I'll be prepared. Good for me. - More than likely I will be  coaching  the Lee County 4-H Challenge Bowl team this year! That is, if there are enough Seniors this time around. I'm thinking there will be enough. If there aren't, of course I'll take the lead of the \"A\" team again, gladly. But, I've come to understand that things aren't about all about me. I've had my turn, gave it my best shot, and we got 3rd in the state! That's not bad, considering the top 2 were from the same county, and they cheat badly. (Sharing questions and answers with radios, anyone?) So really we placed 1st. LOL. But, I've had my turn, and I want to be a teacher and a leader now. I was elected to be a leader and that's my new role: to set an example. - I've decided to use journalism as a backup. I was told to 'find my passion' at GOT, and my passion is 4-H. Therefore, I'm going a career in 4-H. Start out as a Program Assistant in college, 4-H agent out of college, get promoted to district, then to state... and so forth. - My blog (I can't believe I still have it around!) will have a newer, less gay, name and URL. If you see this from now on, you got an email or someone told you."

I played some fooz-ball, ping pong, and even had time to go out to eat!  Friday we won our last game of the season. I dunno why we did so bad at the beginning of the year...we lost a lot of our games by just a couple of points.  Hmmm....what else?   What about your guitar???   Oh yeah! I am just starting to learn the acoustic guitar. And hopefully by the time I am a senoir I will be good enough to form a band. I dont know if I will be any good...or if I will be ready by then. Heck I dont even know if I am any good at the thing...I'm doing some very basic things. Dont know any chords really yet. Just dinkin around. Yeah...if I get good, I have a band in mind....  **smirks**  Only time will tell"
"Jail and Birthday's   The wonderful dog days of summer are upon us and I was in Jail. Literally, amongst some of the inmates participating in a workshop facilitated by My Bermeo. It was a good class yesterday. I took place in the first two freewrites because I had soooooooooo much on my mind. The premise of the freewrite was to write about anything that you wanted. Any subject, any topic, any format. I journaled my way through it and I basically touch of my very low tolerance as of late. The second freewrite was to pick one line from the first freewrite and I go with it. I still stood on the same topic.  It felt good to write. I haven't felt like I have written something decent for a very long time. I still write but it is mostly in my journals. I think I might be using all my creative juices on these blogs.    I mentioned to the fellas that My 4th of July will not see me coming to rikers for the workshop. I want to go to a BBQ and maybe just go into my little hole to be alone. I know that I spend alot of time alone but the 4th of July is different for me. Last Monday ( June 23 ) was the anniversary of me losing my fingers. 11 years and counting. 11 years of reliving bad memories. Constant reminders of pain. The typical : why did this shit happen to me ?\". It is not as bad as it was 10 years ago. Still, I look at my hand and remember that at the age of 22, I had 10 healthy fingers.  So, the 4th is kinda hard for me and I tend to go to my usual spot and be alone. This year, I will be alone but I will chronicle everything in my little book. I need to get a good battery for I can start lugging my laptop around.  Yesterday was Keith Birthday and we met up with him at a restaurant ( sammy's ). They actually had the awesome Chinese food. I had this sweet and sour chicken that was off the hook. Trying to find parking to get there was a mission in itself. Then, when I did find parking, it was about 9 blocks away and I was walking with my good friend \" gimpy \". His gout was acting up and him walking like a normal human being seemed totally out of the question.  After Keith Shindig, we headed over to meet up for Seve's Shindig. He had a little get together at Hudson Bar and books. We gimped our way there and outside was Seve looking smooth the the fresh cut and the Guyavera ( Spanish going out shirt ). Smooth motherfucker you. Inside were some of the regular louder folks and I had a great time. I was kinda quite listening to this one girl talk ( and boy could she talk ). When she started going into religion, that is when I made my exit. I know that there are three things I never talk about, Religion, politics, and sex. Ok OK.....so two thngs. I wanted to go pick up that hooptie and I wasn't waiting for the gimp so I left him behind to pick it up and  walked down Hudson. This is when I was talking about God alot..........  OH MY GOD!!! The people hanging in the village at 2am was crazy. Christopher street was packed. This one bar \" Henrietta Hudson \" was LOADED with people. Mind you, it was a full blown lesbian bar, but lesbian or not, some of these women were beautiful.  I get back to my car. I realized something. I have been part of something only on the business side. I never really sat and socialized with them on a personal level. It kinda gave me a new found hope that things aren't really that bad as I thought.  Picked up the gimp and drove home locally and made some drive by's around some local places.   I got home and parked in the parking lot and as of this moment, I owe them 10 bucks, I am leaving it there for the full 24 hours to get my ten bucks worth.  I am suppose to go out today but it seems that my house will see me for most of the night. Plans have changed and I am glad that they did. I feel better today. I think that is a good thing.  Tomorrow, the fitting of the TUXES!!!! It should be fun. We are going to lunch afterwards and it should be cool.  Another note : I think the outake on Porno's are the funniest things in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   You see things like: 1   Oops, I am sorry I poked you in the eye 2    \"I forgot my line \"  ( WHAT lines are really needed in porn )   Ok, have a good day  Peace, love  Take care  Fish  >)))\">"
"Better give an Xmas update... and a b-day one too... yikes! Well I've been busy playing with my new stuff to post, and besides, I reiterate, who am I letting down? The like 2 people that read this? Anyways, I'm busy playing with the  coolest thing ever , my new  urlLink iPod ! This thing is sweet, I've never really had an MP3 player before, but I can safely say this is probably the best one in existence. I also have cool new GameBoy Advance and I got the game Yoshi's Island, and I went out and picked up A Link to the Past with some of the Xmas money I got. Definitely a sweet item. It's like SNES, but portable, and better! I got Metroid Prime which is a sweet game (game of the year according to  urlLink GameSpot ) but it's hella-hard... and I'm just on the first part, still a great game. Tiger Woods 2003 and NHL 2003 are also now in my GCN library now... both really good games! I got a nice new CD Holder with my name on it. My bro got me Big Shiny Tunes 7 (which is probably the best compilation the series has put together so far). And some other really cool stuff I can't remember... I took my Xmas money shopping and picked up some new CDs. I had resolved to get some rap CDs since a MuchVibe commercial asked me if I was \"representin'\" and I realised that I wasn't, so I got this new Nelly CD \"Nellyville\" and the soundtrack off 8 Mile which I ripped off my bro (heheh...) Both are definitely good CDs, I'd reccomend them to anyone looking for some ghetoo beats! :-) I just used a smiley which freaks me out so I'm just gonna stop here."

"Currentling Listening to: NPR Hourly News ...and now my post... Are we really winning in Iraq? What the Bush administration may have you think, we arn't. Before sending me hate mail, please let me explain. We are losing about 2 US soldiers a day. And for what cause? To get the Bush Administration more money from the Oil Industry. Now here is a nice graph.     This graph sure makes on think, doesn't it? The Bush Administration is leading the US into something we can't undo. We will be stuck in Iraq forever. We have yet to win the War of Terror. No bin Laden. No Saddam. No WMD. Who are you voting for? Bush and his lies? Or Democratic? Me? I'm voting for Clark, Dean, or Gephardt. I'm undecided at the moment. Why? I'm still looking into the education packages each candidate offers. And where they stand on Iraq, the War on Terror, and Foreigh Realations (yes this includes mending the hole with the French)."

A liberal is someone who feels a great debt to his fellow man, which debt he proposes to pay off with your money.  G.

"the middlebrow reader    I decided not to finish reading  urlLink \"The Emperor of Ocean Park,\"  not because it was a bad book -- in fact, it was quite good -- but because I wasn't really in the mood for it. I will definitely get back to it eventually. Plus, it's a hardcover, and I always put my reading material in my Old Navy \"man bag,\" which tends to get really weighed down when there's a 650-plus page hardcover inside. It may not sound like a big deal, but try hauling that around all day long. So I reverted back to my simpler tastes, a.k.a. espionage novels. I picked up a nice cheap \"mass market\" copy of  urlLink \"The Devil's Alternative\"  by Frederick Forsyth and started reading it last night.    I suppose I consider myself a \"middlebrow\" when it comes to books. You won't necessarily see my nose buried in \"the classics,\" although I will occasionally try them out for variety's sake -- I read a few  urlLink Shakespeare  plays earlier this year and enjoyed them in small doses. Also,  urlLink \"Lust for Life\"  is one of my all-time favorite books. At the same time, I'm not a fan of romance novels, \"Oprah\" books, most cookie-cutter mysteries, or those damn \"Sex and the City\"-inspired urban-woman \"Bridget Jones\"-type books that seems to pop up every two seconds. I do enjoy a good mystery --  urlLink Michael Connelly  is an amazing writer who is always able to weave a good crime case around interesting characters.  urlLink Jay McInerney  is probably my favorite \"urban fiction\" writer, if such a category exists. Oh, and while I'm thinking of it, the next time you're in a bookstore, pick up  urlLink \"The Ice Harvest\"  and  urlLink \"The Walkaway\"  by Scott Phillips. I read them both last summer and they're simply amazing.    I don't know where my fascination with espionage thrillers started, but I love them. Among my favorite authors of this genre are Jeffrey Archer, Joseph Finder, and the man I consider to be the master of the genre, Frederick Forsyth. Some of my favorite Forsyth books are  urlLink \"The Deceiver,\"   urlLink \"No Comebacks\"  (an excellent short story collection) and the classic  urlLink \"Day of the Jackal.\"  The latter was made into an equally excellent  urlLink film.  (but for the love of God, don't see the awful remake with Bruce Willis).     here comes the weekend    A couple of nice things are going on this weekend. Tonight Liza and I are going to use her two monthly comp tickets at the  urlLink Improv Asylum  (where she works part-time at the box office). I've been to the show there at least a dozen times, but this one is going to be special because one of the best-known actors there (and most talented, in my opinion) is performing his last show. We'll laugh! We'll cry!   Sunday afternoon my sister Julie and I will be upping the ante on our snooty behavior once again with a visit to the  urlLink Dedham Choral Society's  performance of a  urlLink piece  by Monteverdi. An apparently, during all of these fun-filled events, I'll be dealing with some really shitty weather. So what else is new?    Have a great weekend!"
"iiiiiii was a blue man sunday. X-P wooooo!!!!!  We played drumbone... and above... and... and... and... the computer. Not really.  We played 2 shows... the second of which got far better audience applause than the first. Although... the first had some better parts in the performance, though I'm not saying what they are, you'll have to ask me about that (and why i'm not saying them here).  Chadwina (from the blue man boards) showed up, and she was my guinea pig for the second service, though you can't see it in the video... *sigh*  Oh well.  During the first show, my bald cap cracked, showing that I was a white dood underneath, so I just had to do some impromptu fixin'.  We still seem to have enough blue paint left to do another 3 blue men, which is good. Keith wants me to sell it to him, but I think i'll keep it :) unless... he gives me a REALLY good offer for used greasepaint :-O  I'd... uhh.. like to thank wal-mart for having black sweatpants and shoes during the summer... and... uhh... the sun for sucking ass because its so hot(sarcasm). I'm serious- it was fairly cold outside that day, but I couldn't feel it because of the paint- you just felt the sun's rays going straight into you (much like when you're in an airplane, over the clouds, and the sun is hitting you directly from the window)  \"HEHLLO!!! I ARM TEH SUN!!!!11!! WHAT IS YURO  NAM!#!!EE!!!!\"  \"Fuck you, sun! Owwwww!\"  Then... we went to bennigans, where we had a waitress that had a striking resemblance to Drew Barrymore. Bossy, too. Apparentally \"The Customer is always right\" is unstylish at such a high class place as Bennigans :-P  She was cool though, that was a refreshing change.  Speaking of refreshing, that was probably the most fun at lunch i'd ever had, ever. Nicholas felt the same way.  Heh, my face hurted from taking the makeup off until Monday. Major removal and cloth scraping took place...  The fabric dye on my hands won't come off till... my estimate is Friday. I bet it won't be totally gone until the next monday, when i had mehron on my hands, it took 3 days for it all to get out of my fingernails. And this stuff is the junk you put on Easter Eggs. :-O  But... the scars i had from cat scratches are all blue now X-P  Hmm.. .what else has happened since my major lack of posting occured...  Oh yes, TAKS week. Fucking stupid. Science... when did we learn this stuff? I could have sworn to the non-existant higher power that teachers were supposed to be preparing us for this bullshit. And, when it gets here, if we bomb this information we were never taught, we get fucking remedial classes.  All the smart kids everybody hates (not the nerds, just the ones that are smart to the point that they suck) kept saying \"It's common sense!\" and I kept saying \"The covalent bond of H2Ch3O-fucking-7 ---> 2390rifjsjew388ejddn put into the core of a nucleus at an atom-raping facility is NOT common sense!\"  That's all I'm gonna write for tonight, folks. I'm too tired.  G'nite!"

"Happy New Year!!!! Well I must say, not to toot my own horn, but last night I had a very good time.  I believe my sister and I were successfull in our party endeavor.  And if we didn't provide any entertainment let me tell you, other kids did.  I listened to Matt F. tell elementary school stories for like 2 hours, and I've never laughed so hard in my life.  He told the funniest stories I've ever heard.  Not to mention, TAYLORS HOME!!!! I missed her so much kids, you don't even know.  So last night she slept over, duh, and we had 3 full hours of Taylo and ChubChub time, it was so good.  Then today I've been being a bum all day, I went to Blockbuster to see if they had the movie I needed for history, but it was checked out, so I gave up on that pretty quickly.  Earlier I worked on the big fatty paper I have due on Friday, and it's now 3 pages done...2 to go.  Now I'm going to go get some yummy tea and watch some tv until dinner, because it's the last day of vacation, and I don't want to ruin it by being active.  Adios chicos and chicas.  OH! And by the way if any of you know Preston he likes to call me by my middle name, which I don't have to say, but last night I found out that his middle name is Edgar.  I thought I'd share that with you.  Ok bubye I love you.    *~I guess we've had our fun, but it seems our fun is over now and that's all right. It's all right.

All of my relatives are back there and I get to see them too!!! I'm soooo ooooo excited!!!  I got an email from my aunt tonight and she sounds excited too.  They haven't met Hannah yet, so that will be exciting.    Anyway--I'm actually not feeling so so chatty tonight...just not much going on :-)"

"It's a bit of a paradox that people in our society only get recognition for their accomplishements after they [euphemism for dying]. Like seriously, I for one, was under the impression the Ronald Reagan was already dead, he hasn't contributed much to society since he was officially classified as an old fart, unlike Jimmy Carter with the house-building and shit...The fact of the matter is: It's just too hard to keep up the reputations--Either we all have to die or we have to account for the tremendous backlog in recognition to the reformers of the present."

"urlLink Overlooked  I think i got two good ones for this Photofriday entry :)   Sometimes i really hate trying to get pictures in Oregon.  The diffuse light of generally overcast conditions most of the year makes stuff boring.    And the pile of logs at the bottom of the cliff- they look like bodies or something. But i LOVE this beach.  I call it \"my beach\"."
"A few months ago, I wanted to buy a condo. Then reality struck me, Buy?!? Crap, that's so adult, so permanent and I'm only 23.  But rates are low, blah blah, and I \"should\" buy.  Well there is damn diddly squat out there in my price range and I don't have the patience or cash flow to do major updating like a lot of the condos need. I cant buy a place with pea green appliances and a yellow toilet.  What they&nbsp;heck&nbsp;were people thinking??&nbsp; I can handle painting, new carpet, new blinds. But I draw the line at the lemonade bathroom.  So, I'm now considering renting... against Gary's advising (and he's always right, so I'm not quite sure what the heck is wrong with me).  I found this place in downtown Ft. Lauderdale in an area called Croissant Park. 10 mins from work, 15 mins from Las Olas and a hop skip and jump to 95. New carpet, new paint- It sounds great. I will hopefully check it out tomorrow and, god willing, it will look great too.  Wish me luck!   &nbsp;"
"Cooplander, so true... playing well through a whole 18 hole round is a doozie of a challenge. Usually by the end you'll be getting tired and start fading off, and then there's just the dreaded inconsistencies we all face (I shot 10 on a par 3 once...) But you know I am not playing golf for another month... which could be seen as good or bad. And coop, y'all better not be thinkin of havin' a jam wit'out me! If you can hold it til I get back.... do it.  And Bateman sure makes my camp seem like some kind of Ashley Chivers adventure island but it's not. Okay there may be all guys, but it's like the male bonding (in a good way) and friendship you know and like that dude just likes to skinny dip it's what he does. The kids don't have to go naked or whatever. I got nothin'... that dude is pretty weird when it comes to that aspect of camp life, and most others actually. He's like... the 50's or something. I heard when Dave and Jamie Mclean got kicked out from camp like 2 years ago he gave this big anti-drug rant and was like \"there will be none of the dope here!\" Ah... I cannot wait to go to camp. 2 days gentlemen.  \"Can you quiet down lady? I can't hear myself slurp!\" -Cal from UnderGrads (a grade A show, coopster)"
"Mood: a bit worried... I really dont know about this.  I feel kinda iffy about putting my blog up on a site that Im not hosting.  What if something crashes and I lose my posts?  Well, I suposed that's just as likely to happen to tripod.  Mainly the thing is that I can psot to this blog using my k-tai (cell phone).  Which also means I'll have no reason not to post, so really I'm just making more work for myself.  And the advertisement at the top isn't too bad.  The only real drawback here is that the formatting is a bit too hard for me.  I dont have to know anything about html to make my Tripod blog look cool.  I'm sure I'll figure something out without having to resort to other peoples stuff.  If Tami or Andre know how it would be great if you could help me out."

"Got back from Thailand on Saturday. Had a great time. Spent most of it visiting relatives & friends, shopping and eating. We also spent a fair amount of time seeing the sights and visiting the islands. We were very busy and although I had a blast I would like to spend more time on the next trip just chilling and not going anywhere.  Fake Diesel clothing is everywhere. If you're going to buy it make sure it is very different from what's generally available or you will really look like a tourist (silly).  Places we went  Phuket   Quite nice, Savoey restaurant was excellent, Day trip to Koh Phi Phi was spoiled by wet weather, saw where they filmed \"The Beach\". One of the holiday highlights was the PA guy on the Phi Phi ferry. You WILL enjoy the scenery. These people came to the islands 200 years ago, THEY ARE NOT THAI PEOPLE etc. I was laughing with him almost the whole trip. Try to travel when the sea is calm, take the seasick tablets and chew the small sour fruits availale on-board, surprisingly... they work. Got a major bargain with Fresh's help. Hoodie being sold by a vendor with very red eyes originally listed price at 850 Baht. Got it down to 350. Try to wear shirts which are noticably Thai but not something any tourist would buy. Diesel T-shirts don't count. They will know that you know what the general price for things are.  Koh Pha Ngan  Very nice. Gracious hosts whom welcomed us into their family for a week. Took us everywhere and I had heaps of fun riding in the back of the Ute. Oceanview resort is the best resort on the island. OK Bungalow was better than OK. Very fun atmosphere heaps of international long-term travellers. They book 1 month at a time. Heard about a Swiss man whom looks after a beach accesible only by boat for a local business-man, He's been there for 10 years. Food is nice.  Shopping in Bang Kok  ** Central is the name of a chain of shopping centers. ie Central Bang Na, Central Rama III  - PS2 games @ Central RAMA III or Yeo Han (Fortune Center) - PC games Any IT section of a shopping center shoudl have them. Best  selection I found was @ Yeo Han. - DVDs at Yeo Han or some IT sections - Clothes, surprisingly the best was a small shop on Phi Phi called Narcotica. In Bangkok MBK, upstairs in most of the Central shopping centers. In general T-shirts cost around 200 baht up to 300. Shirts around the same. - House items - Chatu Chak or JJ markets. Now open all week for homewares and furniture.   - Traditional favourites  Patunam for clothes (Didn't go there beacuse too hard to park and difficult to get around as is very crowded. Can be hard to find good stuff but there is heaps to look through. Best prices. No Air-Con.  JJ markets for clothes, homewares, accessories etc.. (Only open Saturday and Sunday) NO Air Con, Extremely busy on the weekends very hard to walk. Absolutely no parking. Toliets for the ladies are not so good.)  Pantip for Games, DVDs etc (Hard to park and far way from where we were staying)  Touristy Stuff  - Jim Thomson house (Nice) - Floating Market (Good, remember to tour around the canal areas, It's great to see how people live around the canals. The canals don't smell) - Ancient City Theme park. Go in December and travel on a bike to get a good feel for things. Take the day. You'll discover a lot about Thai culture and architecture. There are many restaurants. - Emerald Temple, worth seeing once in your life - PP Farm (Cool Ostrich Farm)  - Chulalongkorn's Mansion. Mad dealz. Go visit.  - Kao Sarn Road (Not what I expected)  Food  Good at most places. Noodles on the street are very good and available everywhere. Eat some Rotee off the street. It's a fried pancake and is normally eaten with condensed milk. I had one with Banana and Chocolate. Awesome. If you love seafood you're in luck, it's served everywhere.  Food Loft was the best restaurant we went to. If you go to Bangkok you should check it out. Savoey was very good. Oceanview resort is very good too. Chinatown is mad.  Tastiest food - Crispy skin chicken & Pork Ribs (Da best)   Movies  Movies are really cheap. Around $3.50 for a normal seats which are better than in Oz. Gold class is around $9 - $12, I think. Go watch one. We saw LOR and Once upon a time in Mexico. It was an honor to stand before each movie for the King's song, which is very stirring I might add.  I love the King. He is everything a king should be. He is actually noble.   People are nice everywhere especially in the country.   What you can't get in Thailand. - The latest shoes at good prices. HK is the best for that.   Great things happening in Thailand  OTOP The Elite Card/Club Subways from next April (They're free until August) CEO Govt Management System War declared on Drugs, Poverty and Corruption  Payed a 400 baht fine for overstaying 2 days, I heard about someone who had a 20,000 baht fine. That's 100 days over.  More later. Peace  PS Work sucks I already hate it"
"I am 23 years old today!!! God has really blessed me this year my friend Becky and I drove all the way up to San Jose, about an 8 hour drive to spend Christmas with her family. Her family is so kind and made me feel really welcome in thier home. One of Becky's brothers is a super smart guy, Valedictorian of Princeton and a staunch cold athiest. We had a very interesting talk seeing as his biggest philosophic influence has been Niechtze. I don't buy it a second when someone tells me they really believe what Niechtze has to say, I think Niechtze's Nilhism is synonymous with refinement. More for those interested in showing there intellectual prowess in denouncing God with beautiful writings. Speaking with this bright young man made me realize that knowing why I believe is so important.       Late on Christmas day Becky and I drove up to Sacramento where we met up with a bunch of other friends of Becky's. Complete strangers to me made me a birthday cake, hungout and  just treated me so kindly today; I have not deserved any of it. Minuature golf, air hockey, talking about God and starbucks..... I am stoked!  LORD! You never cease to amaze me, every day you bless my life with new friends and fellowship, all after a long trying spiritual drought. Nothing deep tonight just a feeling of thankfulness to God and a renewed hope. I hope everyone had a blessed Christmas whereever you may be......"

"You know, my mom is deaf in one ear.  I don't know if I've ever mentioned this before, but she is.  One day when she was a little girl she was cleaning out her right ear with a Q tip when she fell or something and...well, and then there was pain I suppose.  Sometimes when we are riding in the car or walking side by side I will be talking about something, sometimes important, and going on and on about it and then I'll ask her opinion and she won't say anything.  It's then that I look over and realize that she hasn't heard anything I've said in the past five minutes.  It's weird trying to imagine what it would be like to not be able to hear out of one ear.  I think there is something wrong with my ears.  They hurt...or itch...or something.  This is a new development.  I think I should probably go see a doctor or something.  I don't want to go deaf in one ear...or both.  Anyhow, I saw Identity the other day when I was babysitting for Wendi for nine hours.  It was a good movie.  I certainly didn't see it coming.  And after I babysat I got to see Jenn's new loft apartment.  It really is quite cool and cozy.  We chilled for a bit and then parted ways.  Last night Sarah and I went to see Braid w/ Panic in Detroit, Moneen, and Recover at the door.  All of the bands were good.  I enoyed PiD and Braid the most although Moneen was pretty crazy and Recover was quite excellent.  Travis was there along with four girls, two of whom were Rachel and Desiree so I talked to them for a bit and wanted to say hi to Travis but then realized that he probably does not know who I am.  I was so tired that I almost fell asleep at many times during the show because we were sitting upstairs despite the excellent music.  Anyway.  That is all.  I get to see Betsy tonight.  Woot."
"In between Valpo and Chicago? Um...Chesterton, Porter, Merrillville, Hobart, Hammond, Crown Point. That's all I can think of off the top of my head that's in Indiana. I don't know about Illinois. All I can say is....I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU GUYS MOVED UP HERE. LOVE IT! I'll help you look!  Just heard from my mom that Ryan is being laid off from his job. He'll have it until the end of the year. I don't think I'm supposed to know, so don't tell! He's looking right now so hopefully he'll find something soon.  Bob's sister, Kristie, is being offered a project in DETROIT with Ford through her company. She'll be there for at least 3 months to set up something there. She'll be provided an apartment and a car. Mike is quitting his job and is going to school full time in Chicago. He might stay in her apartment while she's gone. Isn't that funny how he moves closer and she has to move 5 hours away? Larry and Pam are worried because she can't do anything and they think Mike will never propose. Never mind that they've only been dating 7 months and she lives in downtown Chicago by herself! Kristie thinks this might mean a management position later down the road which she doesn't want to do. I can't honestly seeing her as a manager though. If I were her, I would at least try it!  Anyway, Bob and I had dinner with my boss and his family last night. His son played Take Me Out to the Ballgame on his armpit. I laughed til I cried."
"Nat, I'd trade you ten Todds, two Levy's and a Rosenblatt for a Shep.  I'll also give you my first round draft pick.  There is just something about that boy that makes my aged heart skip a beat.  As for height, Jay Leno is 6'1\" and Shep was pretty even with him, I would put Rick between 5'10\" and 6'.  And bless his little Marine heart, I'd be surprised if Greg was 5'10\".  There aren't many 6' fighter pilots, can't fit in those little canopies. I don't get squeamish very easily.  I've dated too many cops, paramedics, etc. I sometimes come off as being a little calloused.  During my internship at KAMR, they always sent me out on the gore calls because I was the only one that could shoot the video without losing lunch. As far as scared, I'm more morbidly fascinated than scared.  I would probably have been voted Most Likely to Date Ted Bundy in high school. Tonight's libation of choice is Hurricane's so I'm not guaranteeing the spelling or rationale of this posting.  One of my college buddies came home from a business conference in New Orleans this weekend bearing gifts of Hurricane mix and Beignet mix.  You can indulge in one or the other, but it is morally wrong to have both at the same time. For you LevenGals, patience is a virtue.  May's sweeps is almost over, the books will come out sometime mid-June, and then there will probably be a bit of a station shuffle. News is news, but all tv stations (network and cable) live and die by the books.  The marketability of a reporter is just as important as his credentials, and the people selling the advertising want to be able to say, \"Look, we have a huge fan base, loyal audience.\"  And ladies, 20-35 is a key demographic.  You have the power!  Just keep pressing TPTB and they'll get the idea. It looks like I'm going to have to turn everything off so Jay will finally get the idea that it's bedtime.  You ladies have a good night.  Lynne - wish your little one a Happy Birthday for us."

"A mother and her son were flying Qantas from Perth to Sydney. The son, who had been looking out the window, turned to his mother and said,\"Why don't big planes have baby planes?\" The mother, who couldn't think of an answer, told her son to ask the flight attendant. So, the little boy asked the flight attendant, \"If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?\" The flight attendant asked, \"Did your mother tell you to ask me that?\" The boy said that she had. With a clever grin, the flight attendant said, \"Tell your mother it's because Qantas always pulls out on time.\""
"Well, I suppose we have to beat England's former colonies before we can beat the big dogs themselves (though last I checked, US was ranked 9th, ahead of England and Italia). But the reason I mention this match is twofold. First, to warn Adam that we're coming for him, just like the Continental soldiers came for the redcoats. Second, one of the announcers yesterday made a terrible comment during the game. But a little background is necessary. Back in the 80s, the US invaded Grenada for some unknown reason (unknown to me, that is). The invasion was brief (Grenadiens number only 90,000) and I believe quite bloody. Probably an effort to put down some coup d'etat or other. But anyway, fast forward to 2004. The commentators during yesterday's match said \"Grenada needs a 4-0 victory to win on aggregate, and they have about as much chance of that as they did in the invasion back in the 80s.\" I thought this was in poor taste, and I just wanted to comment on it. It reminded me of something George W. would say over coffee with his Yale mates. Kerry, 2004.  Tg go bog , Tadhg Ffrench (cupla focail gaeilge just to keep you guessing)"
"[Ed note: Painful scene. May want to skip it, or delete it outright... Oh, Compton gets attacked again.]  Announcement: Silvius shouts, The peace of the afternoon is shattered suddenly as an explosion rips through the downtown area. The source of the explosion seems to be in the area of Parliament and College E. The blast can be felt for blocks in each direction, and heard for miles. Power flickers and goes out in the neighboring buildings, and car alarms ring through the afternoon air.  Downtown  Parliament and College E  You find yourself in the heart of Cabbagetown. This is one of the oldest remaining residential areas of Toronto. It has been virtually untouched by time. Buildings, their architecture dating them back to the turn of the century, rise all along the narrow one-way streets which criss-cross through this area. However, a new surge of 'yuppies' moving into the area has brought forth a flow of change to the old homes. Entire homes are renovated to a more, modern decor. The streets are now being filled with parked BMWs and Mercedes. Upscale boutiques and cafes are springing up on every corner. The more traditional residents have started to complain, creating a storm of controversy over the historic nature of Cabbagetown. In this case, however, tradition seems to be taking a back seat to wealth and power. Indeed it has, from the sight of the newly cleaned sidewalks and the freshly paved roads as well as the beautiful colouring of the fresh flowers and newly added trees.  Contents: Silvius  Compton shambles up the street, bundeled in his heavy parka and winter boots. He looks spooked, beady eyes flashing about.  Erick arrives from the north. Erick has arrived. Isobel arrives from the south. Isobel has arrived.  Isobel steps from a taxi and begins to run down the street, not an easy thing in heels.... her eyes wide with concern as she sees the damage....  A jittery looking Compton is skirting around what parked cars there are along the street, and peering over top of his erstwhile cover.  Isaac arrives from the south. Isaac has arrived.  Isaac runs up shortly after Isobel as he gets lost in the city easily. He clamors to a stop and a huff as he sees Isobel.  Isobel hurries to take a look around and then moves towards the crowd that has gathered  Erick moves down the street, not running, not panicked. Like a king he seems to move, but then here he pretty much is. However anger is on his face as he surveys the area and prepares for the fall out. Car alarms and shocked screams and yells fill the air, but overshadowing all this commotion is the roar of flames, green flames actually, which currently completely engulf the old McDulan family grocery. The glass of nearby buildings and car windows litter the streets.  Silvius slips into his Robes of Office and into Judge Mode!  Isobel looks over as she spots Isaac and just nods. calling to him \"I caught a cab\" then she begins to move through the crowd.. wanting to hear what the coppers had to say  Compton stands across the street. His face flush with excitement. Doing a fine job representing the do-nothing-voyeur-public in times of crisis.  Erick moves down the street, scanning for only a moment. He taps a few people as he moves by them, the most Irish from the look of it. Directing people to take the wounded to the other side of the street. That thin line of anger still there. The cops are going to show up for this one. He knows it and it pleases him not at all. A few others directed to find the owners of those cars and get the alarms shut off before he moves to where he directed the injured to be taken, god knows when the paramedics will arrive and he is assuming people need help now.  Isaac scans around and makes his way over to Isobel and asks, \"All right, since you got here before me, what do you think happened?\"  Isobel shakes her head and points towards the back of one of the estates where her little apartment is... \"my god I was there only 30 minuets ago... \" she shivers and then adds quickly \"I need to help.. \" with that she goes over to one of the ladies and helps her up from the ground, the poor dear is pretty banged up but she can walk.. carefully she leads the lady to a safe looking stoop, assuring her she needs to have some one look at those cuts...  The interesting thing is, no cops or firemen seem to be anywhere around here. But what's more is the strange green color that seems to permeate the flames. As erick directs the irish folk, they nod, some growing calmer as the seems to recognize the man a bit. They move off to help those they can.  Compton fishes one of those cheap disposeable cameras form his parka's pocket along with a small flask. FIrst he takes a belt of the hooch, to keep the home fires burning and then starts taking random snap shots of the chaos and carnage around him. zzip *CLICK* zzzip *CLICK*  Spotting Isobel Erick moves to the lady she has helped. \"Take her two doors up lass.

"So, I'm going to my new job today. Of coarse I was totally nervous about the time change thing. That would be a really dumb reason to be late on your first day. I had a little trouble sleeping, but not so bad. I hope this thing works out. Right now, I just want something to hold me over until I can get other aspects of my life in order. School made everything so disordered. I felt that I was living in a very artificial world that I didn't have much control over. It was weird.  I'm going to see Masahiko Sunami tonight at Line Space Line. He sounds really interesting, and the compositions I heard on his website were great. I wish LSL had the room for him to do an installation to perform with. I would really like to see that sort of show. There are a few people around who do that kind of thing.  I wonder if it will be crowded? He is accomplished, but popularity is hard to judge in a place like this. That one time I went to see Dan Clucas and had to stand in the foyer was awful. I should have left, but I did want to see him. Or hear him. I heard that Cory might be coming back to LA and setting up a real studio. It is strange about the wife. It's not something that I would ever ask, but you can't help but wonder. Did she get better, or not... Creepy."

"Christinas 2004   RAV Prayer Letter   Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.? ~ Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV)~    Hola hermanos!  Thats what Ill be saying this summer. Im excited yet at the same time nervous. Ill be heading out with our team of 80+ from North California, Washington, and Oregon to Ensenada, Mexico from August 1st-6th. My portion of about 40 team members will be conducting a Vacation Bible School at Ojos Negros. The other part of our team will be showing Gods love to the Mexicans through other VBS programs, sports ministry, womens ministry, construction, and a medical/dental ministry. I hope that you will partner with us as we do Gods work in Mexico!   Calling of The One and Only  I find myself standing firm on His solid foundation. On it I find myself with new challenges everyday. As I go on with life I realize its not for myself, but its all about Him. This summer I will be serving through my church daycamp, this mission trip, and everyday! This will be my first mission trip. This will also be my first time in Mexico. As, I read the e-mail about RAV I kind of thought, Whatever!? The next couple of days I found myself challenged and asking God for help. He guided me to take another look. So, I took another peek at the letter. I felt urged to re-read and re-read. Then, I stood up and said, Here I am Lord, use me! I offer my life, fully. Use it for Your glory!?  This song too played over and over in my head. It still does with the song Make Me A Servant.  Then I thought why not take that leap of faith?? Theres no more hiding and no more going back. Ive taken that big open challenge that was offered to me. At times its still hard to imagine me praying for large groups and sharing my testimony with others. I didnt know exactly what I was getting myself into. I examined myself even further, I drew nearer to God. I told myself go and use that opportunity and live it out, and show His great love that He poured out for all.  Sharing maybe hard for me, but I know now what I got into. Its His work and His will. Doing everything for Him always serves a greater purpose.  God works through different men in different ways, but in the same God who achieves his purpose through them all.? 1 Corinthians 12:6 (Ph)   Whats Up?  Lets just say this Freshman year has gone by quickly and well. I was on the varsity golf team at Campolindo. I also joined Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Crossbears. God has showed me so many things this year. When Im about to fall Hes always there to pick me up. What a awesome God we have! He has taught me to be more content, humble, and patient with my life and the things that I do. He will meet my every need.   Join Me!  Many people have different situations in life, but there are people cheering and encouraging us to go on. Since we do have the summer Olympics this year, will you please team up with me? I would love it if you took time to support me in the days to come and in the fields. I would like it if you would pray that I can (1) trust and remember God is in control at all times, and that its His will, that He will put together all the details of the trip, that He may guide me through the challenges I face as I go, (2) that my heart will be prepared to serve and freely flowing for others, (3) that I can be a faithful servant in all my actions, words, and lifestyle, (3) that I would be willing and open to take leaps of faith? when God calls me, even if Im scared, and (4) that financially, God will provide for me, as this trip does have a high price. Please consider supporting me and returning the enclosed reply card by July 1st. Mahalo from the heart! (We will be teaching this Hawaiian phrase to the Mexicans, meaning thank you?).

"I'm leaving on Tuesday for the exchange. Really excited. Need to finish packing. I've been busy getting ready for the past few days but I'm still far from done. Yesterday there was a going away party (if you can call it that) for the exchange group at Sean's house by the beach. It was fun. We couldn't find the invitation, even after looking for several hours all over the house, so my family just looked up the address and went at a time we thought would be appropriate (around 3:30) . Turns out, the invitation was in my mom's purse the whole time! Argh! Well let me try to recap the past week: Saturday (7/24): Jonathan and I planned to hang out today, and I came up with the novel idea of inviting the whole big brother group. Matthew and Jason couldn't come (busy w/ touring San Diego and baseball, respectively). Somewhere in between Ng calls and wants to hang out too. So it ends up being me, Jonathan, John, Brian, and Ng. We saw  The Bourne Supremacy , which was an awesome action flick. Great camera shots. I went to Panda for the second day in a row. John and I get almost the exact same fortune. Whoa. Sunday (7/25): After mass, went to pick up vacation pictures (10 rolls) from Costco. My mom and I swing by Best Buy to look at digital cameras. We eat baja fresh. There are a lot of asians there. My aunt and my cousin came over. They were planning to shop for a digital camera. So were my mom and I. So we all went to Best Buy. We end up getting the same camera, and I get a scanner/copier/printer/fax. Whoohoo! Hence my ability to post pictures online now ( urlLink http://jtab.photosite.com ). We ate at panda afterwards (my third day in a row). There are a lot of mexicans there. Monday (7/26): Woke up around noon (as usual), ended up going to Burbank to plan what to do on Tuesday for the TBS in store/concert. Took Adrian. Met Triana, Jen, Angela. Chris was sick. I went to panda for the fourth day in a row. Somewhere in between I get convinced that staying over at Jen's is a better option than staying at home. So Adrian and I stay over. We walk around at 2 am, racing shopping carts and stealing flamingoes. Technically, this is already Tuesday, so Tuesday (7/27): We get to sleep at 5 am. Jen has to take Ang to school at 7. Me and Adrian sleep more. After picking up Angela, we end up hanging around Montrose, then Angela's house. Hmmm I guess we're not gonna go to the concert. Oh well. Wednesday (7/28): Did nothing. Stayed at home all day. I must be tired. Or lazy. Or my usual self. Thursday (7/29): Surprize party for Jen's bday. Ang and Tri take her to Outback as Adrian picks me up. We blindfold her and take her to the beach. No one told me exactly which beach. Adrian hits a parked car. End up somewhere near Huntington Bch. We pounce upon an abandoned bonfire. Me: \"Toilet paper makes me ANGRY! AAARRH!\" We leave for Tri's sis's house in Long Beach. Me: \"You might as well just crash the car now.\" Friday (7/30): Do nothing all day. Go to a viewing in the evening in Hollywood Hills. Look around Barnes + Noble for some travel books. I buy a new CD case at Best Buy. Saturday (7/31): Exchange party at the beach. I spend over half an hour looking for a parking space (if only we looked at the invitation we didn't know we had). Sunday (8/1): Everyone wakes up late, so we go to church at the Cathedral. Then eat at the Pantry.  Go to Pasadena for more exchange essentials. Radio Shack and Vromans. I should be packing."

"so i was talking to new wave about the state of music.  i think that's what most of our conversations revolve around, but it's cool.  anyways getting back to my point, the state of music pretty much sucks ass.  i really can't think of an influential band since 1995.  i would say that Pearl Jam has pretty much influenced, in a bad way, the likes of Creed and other bands that sound like Eddie Vedder, but they are old.  then there's that whole rap/rock crap that's out there but they all sound different right?  yeaaaaaah.....  whatever happened to the good old bands that actually had talent, and not some gimmick?  even good ol rap music sucks now, everyone ranting and raving about their bling bling, ho's, cars and what not.  all the beats are taken from old songs and remixed, no one is original anymore, Ja Rule, Mystikal, P-Diddy can all take a backseat to Sir Mix A Lot, Paperboy, Vanilla Ice....errr maybe not them, but seriously EPMD, A Tribe Called Quest, Public Enemy, etc.... put them to shame.  but alas i find hope in band of the yester-years of my life, for example Milli Vanilli, now there's a band that was influential.  they influenced all the new \"pop\" stars out there.  who else could lip sync better than Rob and Fad?  you may say oh well there's Britney Spears, but come on now, she was obviously influenced by Milli Vanilli.  haha okay i'm really lame and i know it, but regardless the state of music sucks, whatever your genre.  any comments?"

"Reporting live from Cambridge, participating in Jamie's yard sale.  (Free coffee and WiFi!) I'm staying with Lisa and Ben and they brought some of their unwanted goods by, hoping to make some money and gain a little space.  There's nothing like a yard sale to purge your closets and basements with the bonus of perhaps leaving with a little extra cash.    This  urlLink yard sale  is not so much like our  urlLink yard sale ; it seems like all of Cambridge likes to get up late on Sundays.  Today's sale started at 10 and we didn't have our first customer until somewhere around 11.  (In Berkeley we had our first customer at 8:15, as we were unloading the car.) Today we were planning to go until 2, but I think Jamie is debating on a possible extension, because there's a lot of stuff left and someone has to want it eventually, right?  Lisa is at the point where she'll actually take a dollar for anything.  But with the Red Sox game starting pretty soon, I think we might have to have to admit defeat and pack it up.  At any rate we're eating hot dogs, drinking beer, and I get to sit on the front stoop and write this, so at least we're having a good time.

"What is your first childhood memory?  I remember my mother coming into my room to wake me up, opening my drapes (its very bright outside) and telling me Youre going to have your picture taken today.  Then we go to the JcPenneys portrait gallery and a middle-aged man with a mustache (it was the 70s, folks) and brown hair is taking my picture, taking care to pose my arm on the fake branch/log prop thing.  I was 3.  When I look at those pictures today, I have a dj vu feeling.  I wonder what happened to that photographer...   Do you have a favorite piece of clothing? Discuss.   I have a story to go with every purse, pair of shoes, and coat that I own.  And I might just lay down in traffic for a few of those items.  But I have little attachment to my actual clothing (i.e. jeans, sweaters, t-shirts and the like).   Any weird morning rituals? (non-sexual in nature please...)

"Exerpts from my writing, to be used in a contest of sorts--  The far off light in the sky forced Hunter Capule to blink. It was white as the stars and it glared at him through the protective film of flesh over his eyes. He screamed as his retinas writhed and burned and burst and as the ringing in his ears wailed. He covered his face with his arm, but the distant, far off light ate at his flesh, forced it to crinkle and dry like thin slices of paper set to flame. The air around him grew warmer, warmer, warmer, warmer, hotter, with the far off light, and he was in an oven. His feet sank into the melting, gummy pavement. He uncovered his eyes, looked to the growing far off light, and the wall of trees, bricks, girders, wind, to the wall of thrashing corpses rolling toward him. The wall lifted Capule like an ocean wave does to a piece of flotsam, and it carried him into the sky, into the heavens, to the parting clouds, the mangled armageddon burning in its wake, the untouched natural beauty of the world beckoning in its path. He thrashed with the corpses, bathed in the far off light, and when he blinked again he joined the ranks of the dead.   Nothing.  Nothing.  The harbinger of consciousness klaxoned in his ears, and his eyes opened to squint at the red digits of his alarm clock displaying four numbers: 06:20. It was time to leave the warmth of his blanket, the cozy gloom of his bedroom, to battle with the world, to stand on the cold street in the pale sunrise, his eyes watching the horizon for the far off light. Maybe watching. Maybe waiting.  --\"Pinnacle\"    And then it came, from some unforeseeable depth, from out of an orifice I had not originally seen. A cloud of dizzying black drained itself from the floor and shaped itself into a fiend I shall never forget, its deep, maniacal voice akin to the sound of raking claws and the guttural moaning of lions before the kill. I could hear it calling to me. The very sound penetrated my mind, tried to force me to remain in my current position, so it could catch me and drag me into whatever underworld collective it had detached itself from. I dizzily backed away, the unearthly fear so great in me that I would have fainted had not some degree of perseverance remained in my mind. I stumbled behind the doorway and slammed it shut, searching with my hands in the dark for a locking mechanism of any kind, but finding none. It shouted my name, as a mother would to a disobedient child. The doors mouth widened, and I hurled myself against it, screaming such screams as men never scream. It heaved its hellish form against the door, knocking me into the hallway. I lay there, dazed and hopeless, and its pitch colored body, which had now manifested itself as a solid form, began to encroach upon my position, its many appendages opened wide, beckoning angrily for my body, for my soul, and for anything else that could ever remain.  Such fear throbbed through my body then, such a paralyzing feeling, enough to nearly detach me from consciousness, but I fought it. I fought the fear and I remained awake, the thing still approaching. I felt its touch, felt its sick, amphibious skin pressed against mine. I think it was then that I lost my mind, that whoever I once was drowned in a murky abyss of horror. I retreated spuriously, still on my back, my screams now coming in harsh rasps. A tentacle darted out and I kicked it away, the claw on the end of it slicing the skin of my leg. I stood, my blood draining away to the floor of the cave, and fled to the distant, almost otherworldly gurgling sound of the water. The thing roared behind me, and I smelt its breath, a vaporous aroma of decaying, rotting fish. I fell into the water, swam desperately, hoping to find some way to the surface. I saw the hole in the ceiling I created; saw the moon above, and then looked back to the cave. The thing was slithering into the water, and when its skin touched the surface an inky stain began to spread about and uncoil, swirling about like the storms of Jupiter.   --\"Numina\"  There are lights in my eyes again.   They said it would be hard, the first few times I was severed, but I never imagined it would be like this. So much was absent from my mind; I could no longer carry on the tens of thousands of trains of thoughtcould no longer feel the stationary molecules making up the hull. The minds of the troopers that were being ferried between stars, blank as they were before, were now completely gone. It was amputation, like my arms and legs had been cut and were lying on the nearby metal grate, bleeding warm blood into the dark, unexplored chasms of the Ozymandias. I could see them, but they were severed from my mind, beyond my control. I felt great pressure in my chest. Tears pressed their way to my eyesmy throat tightened, and the grunt-coughs spurred by feelings of suffering and weakness and uselessness sputtered from my widened mouth. Where are those goddamn drugs?  Looks like hes coming around."
"urlLink Teaching Information Skills in the Information Age: the Need for Critical Thinking   This article is by John J. Doherty, Mary Anne Hansen, and Kathryn K. Kaya.  It was published in  Library Philosophy and Practice  Vol. 1, No. 2 (Spring 1999).  From the article:  A recent report by the Boyer Commission on undergraduate education concluded that universities have too often failed, and continue to fail, their undergraduate populations [1]. Students are graduating without some of the basic skills they need to function in the professional world, such as knowing how to think logically, write clearly, or speak coherently. Thousands of students, they note, graduate without having tasted the basics of research [2]. The report challenges universities to rethink their traditional instructional models, to move to a model of inquiry-based learning wherein the student is involved in research from the beginning. Everyone (faculty and student) involved in the teaching-learning experience should recognize that they are both discoverers of knowledge and learners:  The skills of analysis, evaluation, and synthesis will become the hallmarks of a good education, just as absorption of knowledge once was. [3] In the current educational climate such a model is highly attractive in meeting the faculty's need for research and the student's need for good teaching and learning. As librarians know well, however, research is a much more difficult process due to the proliferation of information. In discussing his vision of the future, Daniel Bell noted that:  In the coming century, the emergence of a new social framework of telecommunications may be decisive for the way in which economic and social exchanges are conducted, the way knowledge is created and retrieved. [4]  When Bell first promulgated this vision of the post-industrial society, or the information age as we now call it, ARPANET, the progenitor of the Internet, was still in the secretive hands of the military. He notes that his vision would be a total break with the past, as there would be \"a changeover from a goods-producing society to an information or knowledge society\" [5]. The key to this emerging new era, he adds, is the combination of computer and telecommunications technology, which is something we now see with the Information Superhighway of the Internet."
"New York was fun, but exhausting.   Tuesday was all focus groups, but we found ourselves with a 3-hour break in the afternoon.  My colleague and I decided it would be fun to do some shopping, but we quickly realized that the only difference between shopping in midtown Manhattan and shopping on upper Michigan Avenue was the order of the high-end chain stores up and down the street.  She wanted to look for girl things anyway, so we parted company -- and after almost an hour of exploring the retail generica you can find in any major city, I stumbled on a Jean Louis David that could take me immediately.  And less than $100 later, I had fabulous new highlights and a much more under-control 'do.  After the workday was over, I cabbed to Arno's house to begin our action-packed 30-hour vacation. After showering and changing out of my monkey suit, we trekked over to Urge to make fun of the go-go boys. Urge is set up with a bar in the middle of the room, kind of like a race track.  The go-go boys work laps around the bar, trolling for dollars and gingerly stepping around people's drinks.  The trouble is, half the bar is a couple feet closer to the ceiling, so the boys have to either dance around all squatty or crawl around on their hands and knees when they get to that part. Either way, they look pretty ridiculous -- and the three dancers on Tuesday were pretty hot, so it's saying a lot that they came off as more dorky than sexy.  To top it off, they threw fucking  attitude  at everyone there.  Now, I'm not one to pay a buck to cop a feel of a guy no matter how amazing he looks -- and if he acts like I'm not even worthy to be in the same room as he is, he's not even going to get a hungry stare from me.  On Wednesday, Arno took me on an exhaustive tour of practically the entire southern third of Manhattan.  We started at a diner on Eighth Avenue in Chelsea, where Arno explained that Chelsea boys are so superficial that they even have a cool side of the street to walk on (the east side -- make a note of it now so you don't embarrass yourself if you're ever in the neighborhood).    After exploring the neighborhood a bit, we hopped on the subway and came up at Ground Zero.  The site is much bigger than I'd pictured, and though the destruction has largely been replaced with the appearance of a standard-issue construction site, I still found myself choking back tears as I contemplated the abject pain and unfathomable suffering that so many people have endured in and around the site since September 11, 2001.  We silently headed south from there for a sunny walk along the riverfront, stopping for a photo op in front of the Statue of Liberty and then making our way down to the southern tip of the island.  Our path north took us through the rugged, pre-Revolutionary War Fort Clinton, past an all-but-destroyed sculpture rescued from the World Trade Center wreckage and up Wall Street, where we stopped in a small museum dedicated to George Washington and the first federal seat of government in New York.   By then we were way overdue for lunch, so we stopped for some mediocre dim sum and then headed to  urlLink Rice to Riches , the coolest niche restaurant in existence, which serves nothing but flavored rice pudding in funky bowls and an even funkier decor.  For our post-dessert dessert we hit Ciao Bella, where I had a succulent pear sorbet that was the closest thing to sex on a spoon I've ever experienced.  We stopped at a bunch more boutique shops on our way home, where I quickly collapsed into bed for a restorative nap, and then we got dressed for dinner at  urlLink Republic Noodles  and  urlLink Johnny Guitar , a hysterical musical homage to Joan Crawford's cheesy 1954 cult  urlLink movie  -- and I was surprised to discover that the new lead is my friend Richard's oft-mentioned ex-boyfriend.  We capped off our day of exhaustive vacation fun at the Eagle, a leather bar (but then again, what bar called the Eagle  isn't  a leather bar?) waaaay out in the middle of nowhere.  The place held the endless promise of raunchy leatherboy fun, but the raunchy leatherboy crowd just wasn't there -- which may have a lot to do with the floor show:  An aging, thoroughly unattractive man wearing nothing but boots and cheap underwear standing on a pool table painting an abstract, monochromatic figure study on two huge pieces of dirty posterboard held together with duct tape.  If this is some new leather sub-fetish, neither of us found any excitement in it -- or in the crowd standing around watching with the same level of interest you'd expect from a bunch of guys with nothing better to do in a half-deserted bar.  We left after a couple hours to head back to Urge, which was hosting its much-hyped Ass Wednesday, which featured an inarticulate, unfunny drag queen hosting a bare-ass contest.  The winner had an amazing little honey-baked ham tucked away in his pants -- and his first runner-up was pretty well-assed as well."

"Yo, if these people don't stop making so much noise upstairs they are going to have problems and situations because I'm about to go up there in my night clothes and start cussing them out.  There is no need for all the bumping and shit that is going on upstairs right now.  It seems like the two of them are having some type of slam dance party where they are throwing themselves up against the walls and floor. I had enough and then started banging on the wall and doing my own set of screaming which probably went on for a minute or so before I realized that I was acting like a child.  Once I stopped banging it got very quiet upstairs and I was able to finally get some rest. Its not that I mind noise, because I produce my own set of noise via my music. I love music and very often play my CDs loud, but one thing I can't stand is being disrespectfully and acting noisy after 10pm. I guess college and \"quiet hours\" got me into that but its just disrespectful to kick up a lot of noise once people have begun to get ready for and go to bed. Maybe I just have a very ill attitude towards Japanese people this weekend and maybe that has something to do w/my aunt flow but whatever it is...its just something I have to deal with for now."

"You'd expect that this post would be about making money. Well, you are wrong. You see, this summer was supposed to be about making money, but it hasnt happened. My boss never calls me in, leading my parents to believe that i am wasting away my summer. It really appears that way, but it isn't my fault i listened to my boss and kept my summer open so i could work for her. Man, this sucks! So today i woke up early, didn't feel like getting out of bed, so i layed in bed for about three hours. I then got up and got ready for my big day... Of doing nothing. After I drank a bottle of water i was inspired to take advantage of the beautiful weather and go for a walk down town. My walk was very energizing, and motivating. While downtown i went to Dunkin Donuts and got a vanilla bean coolata before heading down to Subway for a BLT without the T. Over all it was a wonderful adventure. I saw Jaimie K infront of Adams, I was so happy to see her, i have't seen her since the end of school, which really sucks cause she is a great person... i miss her, her Hooters shirt, and her poncho so much! Walking along the streets of Monson really helped me do some deep soul searching. I realized that i really don't like BLT's, even if there is no T. I also realized that i am very confused when it comes to making decisions about my future. I really have to start thinking about colleges and various areas of interest that i wouldnt mind dedicating my life to. I don't know what's going on. I have felt extremely lonely lately, and just so out of it. Anyways, I had rehearsal for Summer Theater again this evening. Another night filled with dancing my heart out, man i can't wait for it to end.  *I just wanted to appologize for last night's post, i was having a rough evening and had to vent.

Well seeing how English is there third language(not fluent) I guess I got what I should have expected.  Its real short, but it doesn't really matter.  It'll grow and I can always wear a baseball cap.  We got our grade back from the paper/presentation.  We did good.  Its funny looking over the paper, most of the marks came from the section the Dutch student worked on.  I don't care all that much because our grade was better than what I thought it was going to be.  What I do find funny is that I have hardly ever written papers using references and the such.  Still I had an idea of what to do.  During the editing phase the Canadian girl prefered her way of referencing.  Sure maybe it is a legit style, but we got marked off for it in every way.  This Canadian is so controlling and always thinks shes right.  Well she aint, but I am.  kidding    Tonight I leave for Paris, actually Brussels.  We are catching a 6 am bus from Brussels to Paris tomorrow morning so that means we have to take the last available train to Brussels from Maastricht tonight.  We will get into Brussels around midnight.  So that is a good six hours of doing absolutely nothing in a train station.  Why not take any earlier bus, like a Friday afternoon one you ask.  Well the reason is sad in all honesty.  Its because I didn't want to skip a class.  Since I've been in Europe I've only skipped one class, and that was the class I ended up dropping.  So guess what Im bringing to Paris too, a textbook.  Exciting times.  Im on a bus or a train long enough to get some reading done I figure.  Anyways Im hoping in Brussels tonight there will be some bums to talk to.  Im guessing we will try and find a bar and stay till close.  I think Belgium is out to get me, for it won't be the first time I have to sleep there without a bed.  Im looking forward to Paris, well mainly the Eiffle Tower.   I'm sure its just ok, nothing special, but I've always wanted to see it.  It will be a nice escape to get out of Maastricht for a bit before studying for finals kicks in."

"Title Pending   Ugh. I still smell of hotel. There were meant to be two people starting today, but they never bloody turned up, the upshot of this being that the rest of us had more work to do. What fun. 14 rooms to clean, make beds, etc. The state people leave those sodding rooms in is a disgrace, you'd think if they could afford to spend 100 a night staying there, they'd be able to keep the room in some sort of presentable state. But, alas, no. Anyway, enough of that, at least I'm getting paid for it, and the food's good.  Another working day tomorrow, hopefully not as hectic. Out."
"what's up. long time no talk. sorry about that. just couldn't find the time. things are pretty good. went to agape last weekend and san antonio the weekend before. finally home for a while and emily and jerm are grounded. oh well, maybe next week. made a new blog today, but i don't feel like sharing it just yet. maybe some other time. my fish smell and they're dying in their own sick waste so i think i should probably clean their tanks. fun stuff.  rock on."
"hello...  anybody home?...  this is kinda sad without the shout outs, but still, I am glad of the returned sanity.  It takes a little getting used to though.   fro's embarrassing story #1  fro was on the ice hockey team her senior year in high school. ok, ok, don't start laughing already, there's more. It was a big thing for the area to have a girl's hockey team, so the TV crew came to take footage of one of our first games. fro didn't know how to skate before she joined the hockey team, so i don't know why in the world they let her in, but they did, maybe cause it was the first team ever, + they felt bad for the leetle asian girl. The pottery teacher was the coach. anyways..., so pre-game, there was always warm-up, when each team would skate around their half of the ring pretending to look tough and intimidating and cool and all that sort of stuff. My friends were in the stands cheering us on, and we come on the ice. (reminder: fro could just about skate then, but couldn't stop + had very little control in general) so the TV crew - Channel 2 news was on the sidelines filming at one of the doors (I don't know if they were filming live?!?!), and here comes #30 (das me by the way). fro was fine the first lap round, and then, the 2nd lap, here she was coming around, and whop on her butt she fell, right in front of the camera. Absolutely lovely debut! and was she not glad of the visored helmets.   anyways, i don't really find it embarrassing as much as funny, but it comes close.   sidenote: after I shaved my head, after practice when I took the helmut off on the ice, steam would come off my head like it were a dim sum steamed pork bun... *sigh* those were the days...  i had a lack of things to say, but i thought i might cheer y'all up by telling you some of the stupid things i done when i was more stupid than i am now."

"I think my blog sucks    I mean, I sometimes go on blogger.com as I'm sure many do and browse the \"Update List\" and see what's out there. I never visit the \"Recommended\" list because I've always been against recommendations. Often the best books I've read and the best sites I've visited have been off the beaten path. In fact I think the majority of them are. Also what is recommended is usually based on something going on in the Current Events area.. as our 8th grade social studies teachers would word it. For instance on Blogger.com there is a reference to a  urlLink coffee blog . Not bad... except that it's about organic coffee.. something that has taken the world by storm lately and there is  urlLink even pending legislation at Berkeley  to ban non-organic coffee from EVERY coffee house. So, it's a Current Events thing.  I read a lot and I've already read about the coffee thing in the Economist, so I'm not interested in reading a blog about it. What interest me are the real bloggers, the people with ideas that link to each other in this great party.. usually hosted on blogspot.com. I think one of the biggest reasons I don't get invited into that group is because I have built my site around the blog.. so that it's not one of those quickly HTML loads like the vast majority of blogs are.. and infact I would assume without broadband the vast majority of this site would be un-navigational.  So be it.  When I was a kiddie playing on BBS's (Bulliten Board Systems, the first internet... kinda) we had capitalist market practices play out all the time. A \"new\" 28.8k modem would come out.. and the nicest boards would ban 14.4 and lower... when 33.6k came out, they banned the 28.8k modems.. leaving the hapless 2400 baud modem users in the dust to visit Compuserve bulliten boards that hadn't been updated since 1986. We learned that if we were going to keep up with content.. we had to buy the better modem. Of course, broadband is not as easy as walking to your local then Babbages and buying a new modem. Now it's more the service than the modem.. a 21st century model played out first in the cell phone area and doing quite well. Unfortunately services are usually competative against each other.. and thus many don't have broadband. However I don't feel like handicapping my site because I worry that a 56k modem will take a woppin' 76 seconds to load my Career tab. So, if that or just the general lack of quality of my post are what's causing me to be left out the great blog-a-thon.. I'm ok with that.... or at least I'll pretend to be."

"I can't think of a title. Or an opening paragraph. Sorry. Like you were disappointed anyway.* - Mom & my stepdad decided to take a trip to town.

Then Tyler decided  he  had to go... after finally waking up. That made me a little upset. But I went anyway. Jared got a cut, then we went to lunch, as planned. THEN Mom decided she must go to Staples for Tyler's last school supplies. So we went. Then Leonard (my stepdad) decides he must take an hour and a half at our attourney's office.

And I would take it through the open window and set it free in ways it never saw while blinded by transparent glass-  Yet this moth is feverish in its fear no sooner do I fit hands about it that it spirals upwards, upwards, upwards and begins again, that hopeless beating of wings against cold glass.

Yeah, you heard me, a fucking software program is actually making me more happy in my everyday life. Everytime I sit down at my PC there is a comforting interface waiting with a FUCKTON of music hidden behind it's XML driven sheen. It's a bit of a bizarre happenstance, 90% of my music is duly pirated (fuck you RIAA and CCC); But... BUT that figure is shrinking. My god. Not only has Apple made me want to listen to music more, They've made me want to buy more.  Not this pop-y nonsense that goes around like the clap, but actually music. It's been heavenly.  Of course the frequency with which I download music has gone up as well, so maybe that number's there to stay. Needless to say, an interest in music has been kindled, or rekindled and I have apple to thank for it. An iPod shall be purchased, believe you me. Woo."

"The horror, that's all i can say about my left foot, twice it's size and truning from red to purple, it's one of the most unattractive things i have ever seen. The orgin of such a battle wound? I'd like to say it was when a 300lb man elbowed me in the foot...for some strange reason. But it wasnt. It was a freaking bug. Proof that the loliest creatures have a vengance. I recieved this parting gift at andrew's party, where he received food, elementary games, gag cards, a lobster, a bunch of ice with one can of soda (because john is a horrible friend), CD (because john is a good friend), and the idiots guide to tantric sex (because i am an extremely practical friend). FUN was had and i beat up people and the bug got me.  Today i trained as a JC PeNNY's sales associate for shoes. I rock. My foot is really the most unattractive thing to be in that department. I'm hoping the swelling will be gone tomorrow. I made a sales for 2 shoes in like 10 minutes. It pays to know spanish. Tomorrow i work from 1pm till the night. Then Friday it's 10am till 5pm and then saturday it's 4-closing. The adventure of making money begins. It should be painful."
"Outplacement as an employer-paid benefit   James E. Challenger, president of  urlLink Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, Inc. . pioneered outplacement as an employer-paid benefit.  In the September 3, 2002 edition of  Employment Plus , a marketing publications supplement to the  urlLink Dayton Daily News , he has an article entitled, \"Climb up the ladder starts with Day One at new job.\"  Some of the many highlights worth noting include     \"The demands of the New Economy have employers bringing in employees who will make an immediate contribution.\"  \"Resign yourself to arriving early and staying late.  No employer likes a clock watcher.\"  \"Go out of your way to assist peers to show that you can be depended upon.\"  \"You might consider finding out what your supervisor's favorite civic or charitable activities are and volunteer to work for those organizations.\"  \"Calculated bragging means to pick your spot and be subtle when showing superiors specifically how you are doing.\"    In addition, when you venture to the  urlLink CGC website , be sure to download the guidebook entitled   \"How to Find a Job in a Jobless Recovery.\""

"Warren Beatty Has Released More Bombs Than North Korea   A thought occurred to me:  Warren Beatty  sure has made a few stinkers. I mean, I know he is the father of the Washington-Hollywood connection, back in the  McGovern  days when he was a volunteer, and even when he was an informal advisor to  Gary Hart  in 1984, but it has been quite a while between hits for great swordsman.  Ishtar alone lost $37 million. And who can forget  Town and Country ,  Dick Tracy  and the regrettable  Bullworth ? Maybe he should stop being Halle Barre's advisor and take some advice on keeping a career going? (BTW: What is that creepy Padawan-Jedi Master relationship he has with Barre anyway and does  Annette Benning  approve) Or maybe he should just finally take the plunge and run for political office. He's obviously wanted to for years and that receding hairline will not help him in looks obsessed Tinseltown."
"Two nights ago my friend Greg and I went to the Los Angeles Opera to see \"Le Nozze Di Figaro\" otherwise known as \"The Marriage of Figaro\".  It was written by Mozart between the years of 1786 and 1790.  Not to oversimplifiy, but the plot consists of Figaro and Susanna, servants to the Count and Countess Almaviva, making preparations on the morning of their wedding.  The Count secretly has designs on gaining Susanna's love and therefore is desperate to postpone the wedding.  The Countess finds out about her husband's \"designs\" and plots with Susanna (who's not interested in the Count's advances) to trap the Count.  Several humorous situations result - some quite comic, actually!  I never thought that I would LOL at an Opera.    The highlights of this production include the performance of Erwin Schrott as Figaro.  His baritone was amazing, his facial expressions comical, and his overall stage presence was captivating.  Isabel Bayrakdarian played Susanna and she was also amazingly captivating both in beauty and voice.  The set design was incredible including removable walls with rich colors and intricate chandeliers which were hung, a new one for each act.  The elaborate scenery was outdone by the final firework display which ended the show as three of the couples on stage were joyfully ready to be joined in holy matrimony.  There is more to say about the company (Greg and friends) and the night in gereral but if I say it now I'll be late picking up Natalie at work to join some friends at PBC (Pasadena Brewing Co.) and she's cranky when she has to wait for her beer.  ;-)  More later!"
"AFTERNOON MUSINGS   It's official.  I have   ennui   today.  No two ways around it.  I have a feeling of weariness and dissatisfaction.  Almost what Carlos Castaeda called \"a separate reality\".  I am not saying I feel bad, just not good.  Blas.  Hard to describe.  I look out my window and see a woman painting pictures around the doorway of the preschool next door.  It's a beautiful day - in the mid-70's - and even though I am not fond of what she is painting (a nautical theme) I really, really envy her right now.  I would love to be painting outside."

"So much to talk about.  First of all, I just realized that I am really, really sexy.  Like, I-wanna-rip-his-clothes-off-right-this-instant sexy.  I am too sexy for my shirt, and for that matter my shoes, socks and pants.  I'm so hot, I could melt number 7 plastic.

If she weren't ten years older and already married, I would be in love with her.  I I thrive off discussion, and coffee makes me hyper and the combination made it so I couldn't get to sleep until 1:30 (and I tried to wrestle Thomas's dog, Taz, who is on a permanent coffee high).  Of course, it didn't help that Levi's friends were over watching Leeches! (the new worst movie ever) untill 1:00.  We threw him a surprise party; it was lots of fun.   Why not rent the Producers at the Moby Dick party? (Just thought I'd throw that out) In other news... WE\"RE GOIN\" TO STATE!!! WOOO!! WE BEAT CARMEL!!! YEAH!! It was really crazy after we found out, and everyone was hugging everyone else.  This girl comes up and hugs me, then she's like \"Hi, I'm Ashley.\" We'd never even met before!  It was very funny.

"(http://fridayfive.org)  1. Would you consider yourself an organized person? Why or why not?     I would consider myself half-assed organized- more so at work than at home; prolly 'cause I get paid to be organized there.    2. Do you keep some type of planner, organizer, calendar, etc. with you, and do you use it regularly?     I have a planner/calendar, but don't use it like I should.    3. Would you say that your desk is organized right now?     Yes- somewhat.   4. Do you alphabetize CDs, books, and DVDs, or does it not matter?     Hell yes with CDs, otherwise I'd never find them.  Books- no, but someday when I have space to stretch out, I will (I live on a boat- so not too many options here.)  I know  where they all are though, and I do have them logged so I don't accidentally buy two copies.    5. What's the hardest thing you've ever had to organize?     Hmm...that's a toughie.  I guess it would be my desk when I started my current job- there was all sorts of crap left behind from old memos to old \"how-to's\"."
"Adam, dont be so depressed.  I know life is shit sometimes but if you die, shouldnt you think about Anad?  what would Anad do if u died?  hmm..?  HMM...?  whenever u feel like dying just think about how you would really hurt ppl that care about you.  If you die, my life would be happy.  Meaning that you should not die or your most hated thought will come true :D Killing yourself is the coward's way out of life.  In fact, life is a journey, a test.  How long can you survive?  How long can you go on like this?  How long can you take the pain of life until you want to just drop dead and get it over with?  Life has bad points and i know that.  But... All lives also have happy parts like your first kiss, first date, grads, 100% tests *sigh*, once in a lifetime experiences and just having fun.  The longer your life goes on, yes, the more sad things will happen yet there will always be more happier thoughts.  Just be patient.  All lives end the same way.  Death.  Just wait and your time will come but enjoy life and its gifts for now.  Remember, Life isnt the only part of the journey, but death as well.  Struggle, sweat, work.  Never give up.  Because, if you keep on trying something good will happen, if you give up, you have no chance, period."

"MELT  like that spike of ice dangling from the eaves  crystalline and moist like tears on my sleeves  it's so fleeting and not long for this place  soon to be crashing on earth sans grace   it melts like my heart did when I met you  it's a mystery with glorious glints of blue  it sparkles like your eyes when we locked  when my heart's want could not be blocked   glassy smooth, with a forming drop at its tip  wet like my kiss upon your trembling lip  gravity pulls the delicate drop into its lair  like we pulled each others body into a pair   the sun glances to see the ice melt  heating like the warmth our faces felt  shards of diamonds tumble to the ground  glimmering like stones of love all around   the icicles have gone, waiting for the freeze  love has come swirling on the brisk breeze  we watched it patiently drop away  two hearts fueled by liquid spray"

"In response to those who have been telling me I should get a chatterbox, sorry to disappoint, but no. I do not particularly like to flaunt my blog's solitude, seeing as I would probably be the only person to write things on it. It would just be silly that way.  Mmm, five days later and I'm still migraining. Ow."
"[Roz] YAY! I got a haircut today! I absolutely  love  getting my hair snipped - it makes me feel like an anxious and excited 5 year old girl in a candy store, as my anticipation for the haircut appointment builds. I just get really sick of my hair so when I think about getting my hair cut, I get pumped about how it's going to look. I'm sure girls reading this can relate.  So after trying to grow out my hair for about 9 months, I finally couldn't handle the plainess of my hair anymore. I realized that I finally got to the point that I'm wearing it alot in boring ponytails lately. So I got my hair cut to look like Meg Ryan's - choppy and shaggy- how I usually like it.  I probably got a good 2-3 inches off too. My mom and dad said they couldn't tell though - but I think that's probably b/c they don't see me enough. I think it's significantly different. I guess you guys will have to judge from the next batch of photos."

"school as usual today. for est, the teacher had some small game. we were divided into groups of fours and fives and is given a piece of mahjong paper and a copy of nst per group. supposed to find for the word the teacher mentioned and we were given 1 minute for each round. well, my group, which consists of conrad, edward, jeff, wen chin and me myself (bts!) managed to score 14 out of 15. didn't expected that we were rewarded too. supposed to meet her in staff room at 1.10 to collect our gift and during the second recess, off we went to search for her place. ahha, chocolates, that's it. all of us laughed as we didn't expect it too. anyway, better than nothing. conrad and i took a piece as i was bit hungry at that time. school ended at 2.30 and i reached home around 3."
"...now i'm a believer...  So, I am really no longer going to doubt Johnny.  For months he has been saying he was just going to show up one day in Brooklyn.  All last week he kept telling us, \"See you on Friday!\"  Didn't believe him.  So...Friday after work I headed on over to Peter and Joanne's for dinner with them, Bea, Dollar Bill (Jeremy's cousin) and Jer.  I'm enjoying the conversation, eating cheese and crackers when who should come sauntering in with Jeremy...Johnny!  That old trickster!  We had a good night - Thai food, fantastic hospitality, talking, etc.   After leaving Peter and Joanne's, the three of us headed back to Brooklyn to go to the bar Freddie's where Brian and Laura's band, Dust Dive, was playing for Brian's birthday.  Their music is...sigh...beautiful.  It breaks my heart.  Then it was home, home, home...late.  Saturday Johnny and I decided to adventure since Jeremy was at work.  We had lunch at Daisy's diner then decided that  urlLink this  was where we needed to head.  This museum is actually a room, and not much more.  After entering a non-descript building on Union Square East and finding \"suite\" 600, we walked into a room of people whose heads all turned as they proclaimed, \"Wow!  Real visitors!\"  We were given the grand tour and had it explained to us that they rent out their space for various groups to meet in.  We had interrupted the Star Wars fan club of New York meeting!  There were no hipsters in sight, and we even had one guy say, \"I am the comic book guy.\" They all cleared out soon after and we could actually get to the walls, which featured work from the book \"Broad Appeal\" - all cartoons by women artists.  As we were talking to our tour guide once again, another worker (ponytail, pale skin, black clothes) came out with a stack of papers and said,\"What, praytell, shall I do with these?\"  Wow.  It was a good time, and I highly recommend supporting them if you ever find your way to New York. I'm going to sum up the rest of the day/night quickly - we left, called Bill, walked many blocks in the rain laughing, got to the Dia, caught a cab to Guru for dinner with Jer, walked around the East Village, had a sticker booth picture made of us with a Zapatista frame, met up with Judie and Bill at Gem Spa,  Judie left and Bill came with us to Brooklyn, partied late into the night with beverages and such, Bill threw down some rhymes, lots of stories and laughing, we tossed Bill into a cab about 1:30, I crashed, the others crashed, Bea called us at 6:00 a.m. freaking out wondering where Bill was (he had slept in the lobby apparently.)  Then it was time for work...  Sunday passed as it usually does...no need to go into it. Monday we bid farewell to Johnny (we miss you buddy!) and hello to furniture and art that Rick passed on to us.  This was the last time I get to see Rick before he moves to South Carolina.  I don't know when I will see him next...this is sad.  I have become close to Jeremy's family here, and it is hard to move away, and have them move away.  I guess these things must be done.  Good luck with your train trip, Rick, as well as settlin' in to a new place.  I'm exhausted by all of these words."

"GIRL FIGHT!  Seems like there was a bit of backstage drama at the recent European MTV Awards which were hosted by Ms. Christina Aguilera.  Seems that singer Pink and Aguilera are having a war of words in the British tabloids.  Pink, who closed the show with her new single \"Trouble\", is said to have  urlLink threatened  not to perform on the show if Christina dared to introduce her.  In the end, the record label was forced to hire a separate radio DJ to introduce Miss Pink.  It seems Ms. Aguilera has accused Ms. Pink of \"copying\" her look and style.  Meanwhile, Ms. Pink has been quoted as saying, \" If that bitch mentions my name once Im not going on stageand Im not kidding. ? *MEOW*  My money is on Xtina by knockout in the 3rd round.   SOME SLOW KYLIE  Take a gander at the new videoclip for Kylie Minogue's  urlLink \"Slow\" .  The opening shot is breathtaking.  This video has enough scantily clad beef to have a barbeque for days.  The song is a nice, slow percolating ode to take-your-time sex. Yummy!"
"All this talk reminds me of a country song by one of my favorite singers Collin Raye called \"Not That Different\"--'I laugh, I love, I hope, I try, I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry, and I know you do the same things too, so we're really not that different, me and you.' OK, I'm singing it now, but it really is a great song. Good thing this blog doesn't have audio...It's something I try to remember when I'm talking with people I'm not really fond of....Plus, Collin is a pretty hot guy... :-)  Denise, that does make a person feel old, remember when we used to HAVE to watch the commercials or walk all the way across the room to change the channel? I actually bought the family's first VCR (I'm thinking 84?), my dad said \"This is going to be just another thing you use for 2 weeks and then it will collect dust forever\", I still throw that at him from time to time....I sounds like you enjoyed your concert, that's always a good thing after spending the money, I don't go to too many concerts, mostly because it's either a trip to St. Louis or Chicago, all the good ones don't have any interest in Peoria...but I've seen Phil Collins a few times...  Our storm last night took care of the excessive humidity for a while, now today it is sunny and warm with a breeze.  Last night the storm hit so fast, I didn't even realize it. The wind was nuts, up to 60mph they are saying today. It blew some siding off a neighbor's house and snapped power lines all over. I swear it was the closest thing to a hurricane we're bound to experience this far north.  PU-no such luck....how long do we give him this time???? I was thinking if he did do anything with it on that Wed? Thurs?, he probably sent it through the mail room and it is up to them to get it out, maybe another week??? Let me know, I guess I'm the next logical one to remind him....:-)  Melissa--217 pages a day is awesome. My sister is up to page 600 and she thinks she has it figured out, I'll have to tell her that you thought you had it figured out too, but were surprised, she trys to predict too...  Natalie-You go girl, get that idea all fleshed out and start writing...of course, I'd like my book signed by the author....Could that 'stranger' be a hot Jewish reporter? (minus a girlfriend).....  Jayel-I've noticed how Shep 'badgers' Jane Skinner too, I imagine it's like an older brother thing (I don't have one), Shep has mentioned before how all the Fox people really like each other, and it really does seem to show... I've also seen how CNN is using a lot of their war footage, it makes me think Fox should get more mileage out of their 'much better' reporters.   Well, I'm off to a community play tonight, spending some quality time with my mom, I think my dad is opting out, but I'm not really sure. I'll check back later...."

"All things are possible.... Why the self doubt?  Why the feeling that I won't be able to do it?  I don't know, the whole Idea of doing something as \"extreme\" as graduating my junior year seems pretty tough.  IF there's a chance that I'll be allowed to do it, I'm going to try it.  All my friends are Juniors and the thought of not seeing them all of my senior year is just too much.  Even Erika will graduate before me, and then go off to some college just east of Guam!  I just don't want to be alone.  Do I depend on my friends too much?  I just know I need them with me at school.  I looked around the table today at all these great people, my friends and then it struck me, next year will probably be last year with them.  It can't be that way, I won't let it."
"Today is blah. Just get me to next weekend, when I can dance with my fellow Escorts at the BK competition. Ha ha, we're gonna be so weird. Yet fun, too.  What the heck is college? Get it away from me, I don't want it on me! Ewww, now the college is in my hair and on my clothes! Geez, now I have to shower...   It's ok to be angry and never let go It only gets harder the more that you know When you get lonely if no one's around You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down We came together but you left alone And I know how it feels to walk out on your own Maybe someday I will see you again And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend   Fork it.  God bless"
"I stopped by the new store tonight. Me, and oh, 1 ... 2 ... 500 other people! I found a parking space pretty easily (I have good parking karma) and I didn't plan on buying anything, so I just wandered around. I almost jumped for joy when I saw they had pineapple cream cheese ~ strawberry even! Great joy!  But the real stunner was finding my favorite yogurt! Hallelujah! Nearly four long months ... (Yeah, I bought it at other stores, but still!)."
"I'm feeling a bit miserable today. I don't know why. I had my first nap at home in 2004 today. I was in my room, watching Bulletproof Monk, and suddenly, my eyes went tired and I slept for 2 hours. Haha... bet I can't sleep early tonight.  ~ Well, there's nothing much to say about today. I'm a bit pissed off when they canceled the movies tomorrow. I was just thinking that after the trial, I would rather watch Catwoman and King Arthur. Anyway, the last minute cancelling disrupted my weekend schedule. Now, I would have to follow plan B, where I would go to Wesley Methodist School or SMK Bandar Baru Sri Petaling tomorrow for their Installation Day.  Went to McDonalds today and tried the fried prawns. I can't remember the name for the food already. I didn't like it. It wasn't crispy enough and not fulling at all. Next, I would love to try the McPrawn, the one that comes with a burger.    SPECIAl Joke of The Week:   This is a real story and it happened on the 8th July 2004, during lunchtime, in front of our school hall. Jon and I was there, with  urlLink Meng Yen  and Shook Yee. Pn. Siti was so happened to pass by us, eating an ice-cream.   Meng Yen : Wah teacher, eat ice-cream ar. Pn. Siti : Haha... this is not for people like you! Meng Yen : Wad!  At that time, Jon and I burst into laughters.  In random, the Japanese Festival is back."
"There's also something else going on, too.  I've been debating on whether or not I wanted to blog about it just because I've been very private about this.  It's about this crush that I've had on and off for the past three years on one of my best guy friends.  I never wanted to bring it up because I feared his reaction and what if it messed up our friendship.  Anyway, last month, I stupidly got the nerve to tell him.  I don't know what possessed me to do it, but I did...  now, that he's back in california and I've seen him a few times, I'm not too sure where this is going.  I know that he makes me happy just as he always has been able to.  I know that our friendship is still very comfortable and I still adore him in that sense.  I know that our trust in each other, if anything, is growing stronger and stronger as we open up more to each other.  Right now, we're just taking it one step at a time...letting time take its toil...missing him though.."

"Hey gals, been a really long day for me.  My boss didn't say what happened to that girl, maybe I'll ask tomm.  I had a bit of road rage as I sat in traffic for 45 minutes going 3 MILES!  I had an appointment to go to and I was going crazy.  Ok, I got that bit of frustration out of my system.  We are having this contest at work that I decided I needed to join, and somehow got roped into being the team captain, so my workload has increased because I now have to babysit.  The contest is called Waist Away (we could really use you Jen) we have a team of six people and we have to weigh in once a week at the nurses station.  At the end of 8 weeks, the team who has lost the most cumulative (sp?) weight wins a prize.  I am now the cheerleader, motivator, and score keeper of my 5 other co workers.  I felt that since there is a competition involved, I might get off my butt and do something!....I wonder if I could include this on my resume..hmmm  Nat   I am sorry to hear that you did not get your picture, maybe you have a \"special\" one coming!  I forgot to mention that I live about 2 miles from the main post office of the entire city, so maybe mine got here quicker because of that....keep your chin up buckaroo, yours is on the way! BTW  I replied to Rick with my address on or around 6-2, so if that puts things in perspective.. At least you have the jeans vision to keep you company...I missed it.  Funny about the comment on Hurricane Bill, I was thinking Bill O'Reilly too...he is a hurricane LOL  Leslie  My mouth was watering reading your dinner menu!  I love seafood, I could eat it all the time...I once dated a guy who worked at a seafood shop and he would bring home (and cook) a fresh seafood dinner for us everynight, it was amazing!  I think you may be on to something with asking Rick to send pictures of other Fox reporters!  If nothing else he might mention it to them to send photos out to those who e-mail them, since he does!   Your hubby sounds amazing *sigh* if we could all be so lucky....Congrats on your anniversary!  Jan   Glad you got your pic today, that tie!  Only Rick could pull off that tie, I don't know many men that could LOL.  At least we know he doesn't mass produce the messages on the photos, he varies it a little.  I also find it cute that he actually addresses his own envelops, it just makes it that much more special!  Melissa  I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I finally figured out what was bothering me about Mike Tobin, he looks just like my OBGYN.....except my Doc is cuter! Ok now I'm blushing...I like the idea of keeping the girls here together, even though I am new, I kinda like it here!  I don't like the idea of reading something on here and getting pi**ed off because people are being mean, or rude to anyone.  I just hope you don't put too much time and work into all of this....you need to come out and play too! BTW kudos on the drawing..I went to an Art school and I can't draw a lick (stick figures are my specialty), let us know how the coloring went!   Sherry  Glad to hear you last day at work was a good one!  It must have been hard to say goodbye to so many people, I've left jobs and cried leaving some of the people (never cried about saying bye bye to the job though..hmm), and I have never worked for a company that long....best of luck in school, it is a whole different kind of stress...I work full time and go to school part time (I like to alternate my stresses LOL) what are you taking in school?   BTW where in PA did you go camping?  I grew up in PA and my family is spread throughout the state, I grew up in a town where city people went to vacation (listen to me, \"city people\" what is that all about? I must be tired)  I'm glad to hear that it was a good trip.  I am fading slowly and getting goofy (I am actually singing Twist and Shout as I am watching Ferris Buellers Day Off) so I must get myself in bed and try to beat the cat to the pillow!  Later"
"Charley is currently in Jamaica, and from about 8:00 tonight until 12:00 tomorrow it will be terrorizing the Cayman Islands.  My family is there and I just read some news about hurricane warnings.  Everytime there is a storm there, alot of people leave the island.    A little insight into the Cayman Islands...  The island itself is about 20km by 10 km and the highest point on the island is only about 20ft above sea level.  The island is basically an overgrown coral reef that was exposed when sea levels dropped a thousand years ago (whatever).   So as you can imagine, any significant storm that hit directly would pretty much wipe out the entire island.  A little insight into my family...  A few years ago when hurricane mitch (class 4 out of 5) (5 being \"the perfect storm\" type of storm) came through the carribbean most of the people left the island.  My mother got in to a truck and drove around the island taking pictures (one of which was shown in national geographic.)  Orignially, the hurricane was on a path for the island, but ended up veering towards honduras so they only got hit at about 75% strength.  Otherwise there would be no cayman islands, and those swiss bankers would be very happy.  Charley is currently a category 1 hurricane (the weakest of the 5 ratings) so im not too worried about them despite some island hurricane warnings.  Anyways, you can see the storm at:   urlLink http://weather.yahoo.com/img/carib_websattropir_440_mdy_y.html  ,  Grand Cayman is that little black dot between Cuba and Jamaica."
"Dear Lei;It is Monday 4th August 2003, it has been two weeks since we have talked. I stayed up until the sun came up Sunday morning hoping to see you online. I did not. I miss you very much my love. On Thursday it will be my birthday. I will not be doing anything to celebrate it. No sense in it. The only thing that I would wish for is for you and I to be together. Last week and this week I have done a lot of cleaning. I almost have my back bedroom clean. I moved my sons desktop in there. He starts school on my birthday. He will be starting 3rd grade. Everyone here keeps asking me if I have talked to you. You are on my mind all the time. I am hoping that you send me a letter soon. If or when you do, I will write back to you. Things are going ok here, I just wish you and I could talk again. I was really glad that I could see you on a web cam the last time we talked. I Love You and Miss You Very Much. I still have your picture on both my computers desktops. ;-) If I can not talk to you, at least I can still see you and you are still very much in my heart. Well until we talk again my love.Je t'amie LeiLove Kevin"
"i was posting a message for my online class about dreams, and it got me thinking about some other stuff. when i dream, i live out another person's entire day (for the most part, no matter how surreal it is). when it is over, i go to sleep. then, i wake up in my \"real\" life. sometimes i feel exhausted from being involved in another lifestyle. (am i crazy, yet?) i'll explain it in more detail.  i'm sure everyone has had that sensation when they are waking up; you get excited to drive your new car, or spend all your million$ of dollar$. then, reality crashes in and you're back to your crappy life. (right?)  for me, it goes a little deeper. i have actually been in dreams and been reminded of ppl and locations FROM OTHER DREAMS. but those things do not exist! i have had dreams where i interact with close friends, but they are not real ppl i know. i have even had fake girlfriends, and even been reminded, in dreams, of ex-dream-girlfriends! when i wake up, i do not know who any of the ppl were, even though i can picture their faces and stuff. every couple of nights, i will go back to that neighborhood and hang out with my fake friends again. and of course, there are dozens of other identities and locations, which i revisit time and again. this has gone on for years. i have all these different alterego universes...in my subconcious.  so, basically my mind is using valuable memory space to store all these scenarios. and they are linear. let's say i dream about trying to find a job in suburbland on monday. the next night, i'll be in warriorland with its storyline and identity. some time later, i'll dream about suburbland again, and pick up where i left off. this time, i'll be at a job interview, as though no time has passed! what is that all about?! i mean, in all these dream lives, i have a specific personality with habits, memories, and motivators. why does my mind feel the need to file all of these character traits? is it really necessary for these dream lives to have a past? especially when i usually have lucidity and understand that it is a dream and not real, while it is taking place. i knew a native american woman who told me that when she dreamed, she would watch someone else's life unfold. she said it was part of her culture, and she could even choose a specific person to inhabit ahead of time. she also claimed that she could control their actions, and mess up their day if they had pissed her off. is that real? maybe when ppl on the other side of earth are sleeping, one of them is passively watching my life, and it does not make sense to them. perhaps, i am not who i think i am, but only a drifting spirit who is in this body today and must act accordingly to my prefabricated personality? does any of this make sense, or does it sound like the rantings of a crazy person? i have tried to understand this for some time. do you dream like this?"
"Wel my computer is officially GAY because it decidedto fucking DIE so I have now got NO FILES because its fucking DELETED ITSELF so all files fro any websites are gone, all pictures for the new DNP are gone, all my msn stuff is gone, all my general writing stuff on comp is gone but most importantly my work shadowing letters and coursework is gone so I have to redo them all so fuck off you fucking mother fucker of a computer technology is gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.

"so, today is wednesday, which means yesterday was my senior speech. it really sucked. the minium time requirement to pass is 8 minutes, i got 9 minutes and 24 seconds. it was awesome. so, i passed that part of the speech...but there's a problem, i don't know what my over all grade is. after my speech (i went first) three other seniors went up and presented and then we left, that's it, the head judge (mr.proscher) got up and said, \"okay seniors, thank you for your presentations. you may leave now.\" then we left and that was the end of it. so now, all i'm doing is waiting for my freaking grade. another thing that i have yet to explain is The Day of Acception...and i'm not going to do it right now, maybe later on today; i just have the time to get into details and stuff. bye kids."

"Many people were at the University Fair.   As Belky, Lynn, Renae, Victor and I were driven downtown by Renae's brother, much worry was bestowed upon myself as well as others as Renae was visually ailing.  Arriving after an unenventful journey, the father of time itself could give no guess as how we would fare.   Although, that was not how the day was started.  For in the morning, the schooling with which we were to part take in was all worthy enough to have a post of its own in this humble book of lives and life.  When arriving at O'Conner, time was painstakingly consumed as those longing for lessons only arrived at a storage room.  Our information being more than a little distorted, Veronica and I failed to locate the room we were to train our Japanese language.  Though, after extensive search, we arrived at the proper area, just in time to start our hour-long wait for a teacher.  After recieving notice of our teacher's absence, the class in its entirity migrated accross the hall to the Eleventh/Twelfth grade class.  The teacher, a wonderfully funny Filipino man reverted to a review stage and many of us learned the uses of Particles and counting systems.  I created about half a page of notes that is currently in the possession of Veronica.  After missing the break, we were let out about 60 seconds before the anouncment that instructed teachers not to dismiss their pupils until the bell.  The very, very loud bell that met us while we greeted Renae.   After hasty goodbyes and a few phone calls, we (Renae and I) were on our way to her house to wait for the others.  Thus you find us where I left off, arriving downtown at the Convention Center Building North.  On our way to the South building, we bumped into Anne-Margareth and Donald's group.  (Please, excuse spelling).   Most of the people reading this should know what happened next.  There was an argument.  The details of which don't have to be displayed, but the 5 minute argument ended with me walking off and sitting at a bench for over an hour.     After returning, I was found by a teary Renae and an also worried Victor.  After meeting with an angry Belky and a stalling-Renae's-mom-on-the-phone Lynn, I took Renae to talk over alone.  Most likely another hour passed before Renae and I returned.  During which I learned of how sick tired Renae ran around the convention center looking for me.  I learned how she almost fainted from fatigue.  I learned how much pain, suffering and humiliation she went through.   All I can say about this experience is, I'm sorry to everybody that's involved for what I did.  And I'm sorry to Renae.  I love you, and I make a promise on this day, and on this page to prove it to you in all my actions, and do the opposite of what happened on that day.  I will always try my hardest to only give you what you deserve, the best, and always only the best.  I'm sorry to those involved, and thank you to everyone for taking your time reading this.  -ArV"

"so we had a party.   it was fun.  i really like our parties.  today i have to do a lot of fucking work.  i havent done any work all weekend and its already 2pm and i havent even really started.  plus my fried susan's birthday party is tonight so i have to do everything before that starts.   p.j. spent the night last night and wouldn't leave until just 10 minutes ago.  i like to sleep with him but i just want him to go home after that so that i can start my day, you know.  i dont want to lay around and watch tv.  i want to do my work but instead i have to lay around with him for two hours and then drive him home.  thats why i like sleeping over his house more so that i can just go home and leave him when i want.  i really like p.j.  but he got pretty drunk at our party and started acting stupid.  which is understandable, because people just act stupid when they are drunk.  but its not funny when its your boyfriend.  its more embarrassing.    im glad i decided not to tell p.j. about my blog.  otherwise i would never be able to talk about him.  and that would suck."

If it's on the 8th it will probably have to be in the evening, whereas on the 9th it can probably be in the afternoon.

In the first chapter Han invites Leia to polish his medal. In the second chapter, computer terminals get thrown onto people's heads. It's really funny.   Ouch!

"i L O V E it    i was pulling out of my driveway with p.'s gift on my lap.  i was on my way to pick up one last thing for him and then to send the package out (finally) along with a letter.  as i was driving (dangerous, i know), i started opening the package and what i could see from opening the package from the bottom end was the coil of earphone cord and some clear plastic packaging.  i was thinking (sorry), \"gee, he got  me the cd player with 45-second anti-skip at wal-mart for $60....  act happy,\" because p. wanted to know as soon as i received it and whether or not i liked it.  do you know what i did?  i started laughing out loud to myself, while driving alone in my van.  i  love  it p., thought i didn't know i wanted it,  urlLink it  was exactly what i wanted!    thank you....!    you see, i've been kind of sad of late.  things going through my head, weighty decisions to be made in the very near future so it was the most refreshing relief to be reminded that someone loves me and understands me.  it took p. and me more than six years and so he's not going anywhere if i'm not going anywhere and that is  really  reassuring at a point like right now in my life.    king's palace    had a hell of a time finding a chinese restaurant on quinpool road (read: eating district) for lunch today.  it's new year's eve and i wanted to visit a restaurant that suffers (and reaps a lot of profit) on a crazy day like today.  my first two choices (  china classic   and   king wah  ) were incidentally closed over the lunch hour on tuesdays and wednesdays.  i wasn't fond of the idea of eating at   dragon city   and so we settled on   king's palace    it wasn't too difficult to decide to go for a lunch special - at $4.95 - $5.65 for specials.  i like how you have a choice between three specials each day of the week.  r. and i chose one for $5.65 that offered and egg roll (default meat one, spring roll for $0.25 extra), beef fried rice, pepper chicken (hot) and sweet & sour chicken (balls) or honey garlic ribs.  i was picky and had my egg roll changed to a spring roll (cabbage, carrot, and barbequed pork), and made a substitution to have steamed rice instead of fried rice.  r.'s egg roll surprised me.  it was open-ended so the meat at the ends was scorched and crispy.  (i like how our meat egg rolls are close-ended and there isn't much ambiguity with ours that it contains ground beef with some onions for flavour!).  my spring roll was quite oily - to which k. would respond, \"gee, what do you expect when it's deep-fried??\"  although the cabbage / carrot / bbq pork stuffing is kind of westernized (ours have chinese mushroom, bamboo shoots, waterchestnuts, and pork.)  the pepper chicken was okay, kinda laden with onions and green peppers - i like how it was seasoned with sesame.  and the ribs were chewier than i thought they would be - i wonder if ours is as well?  i guess it was decent for undifferentiating canadian customers....  i'm not going to rate the restaurant - it was unfair since i drew so many comparisons with my own!    chicago    chicago was a great movie.  oxford is a great venue for the movie (that is not being shown anywhere else).  i also learned that the best seats in the house are second row in the balcony (first row if you're tall enough!).  i wonder how the musical would have been shown in a theater....?  makes me yearn to watch plays at neptune in the very near future.  and i'd imagine that the soundtrack (if chicago is indeed a mainstream movie) will be quite popular.  a must-see for anyone with some sense and taste.     urlLink read more...."

One by one interviewees before me would leave the room either baffled, confused, smiling, upset, mad, sad, etc. I didn't take long with the consul. He was quick and I answered the questions directly.   As you know, I got approved. Whilst other folks would get denied one of whom needed to go to visit her sister who's in a terrible condition. I felt bad for her.   I'm now getting myself ready for the trip. Getting my tickets and making my cash advances. I need money of course. I have also asked friends if there are things they needed from the US that I could buy for them.   The thing is, I'm not so excited for this trip.

"So, out of the blue, one of my two best friends from elementary school, Heather McDonald, e-mailed me.  I haven't talked to her since we ended up at different high schools, but she apparently happened across my blog.  She says I write exactly like I spoke in 7th grade, which sounds insulting, now that I'm repeating it, but was actually kind of cool to hear.  We met at Politics and Prose for coffee and to hear Ron Suskind speak.  (He's hilarious and charming and smart, by the way.)  It was great.  She's a total hipster now (Shins tickets, thick-rimmed specs, all black outfit, bleached hair), but she also still sounds like her 7th grade self to my ears.  Yesterday I was whining about how disconnected I feel from some people.  Well, Heather reminded me of how sometimes it works the other way around, and you meet someone whose brain seems to work the same way as yours does.  Yay!

"I'm feeling pretty good about supporting Nader these days. If Kerry gets the nod, I'm not inclined to vote for a Bush-lite candidate. Besides, I think Ralph Nader tops the list (which also includes France, Russia, Germany, and Kofi Anon) of individuals the American people at large need to issue apologies for. Everything Nader said about corporations running Washington has come to pass. And moreover, everything he said about Dems just being a shade of gray off the Republican party was proven when they backed Bush on Homeland Security, Afghanistan, and Iraq.    urlLink The Seattle Times: Nation & World: Campaign Notebook: Nader candidacy expected  \" WASHINGTON  Former Green Party candidate Ralph Nader is poised to declare that he will seek the presidency again this year, this time as an independent and despite a vigorous effort by the left to dissuade him, according to friends and associates.  \"I think there's very little doubt,\" said Micah Sifry, author of a book on third-party politics and a longtime Nader watcher. \"I think he's going to run.\"  Nader, blamed for tilting the 2000 election to President Bush by siphoning off votes from Al Gore, twice has delayed saying whether he would be a candidate, but insiders expect the declaration next week.  Sifry is part of the campaign to stop Nader from running, including an open letter to him last month in The Nation, a liberal magazine that has been associated with Nader for 30 years. Nader contributors from 2000, such as Ben Cohen, a co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, also are organizing \"No, Ralph, No\" efforts.  Some Nader advocates had an epiphany after the 2000 election. Bush beat Gore by 537 votes in Florida, where Nader received 97,488 votes. Nader also arguably cost Gore New Hampshire.  Nader always has rejected the spoiler label. \"It is not my job to elect my opponents,\" he has said.\""

Instead of struggling to control this chaos, we must learn to ride it out, regardless of how we feel about the place it carries us.  Most people in the \"civilized\" world spend their lives running from the things they fear.  This is, of course, a perfectly natural reaction and has insured the survival of the human species in many situations.  However, one of the chief differences between humans and other animals is that we have the ability to turn and face the things we fear.  We can choose to stand and fight, or even to stand, observe, and learn.  Some primates will turn and fight for a moment or two, but only humans have the capacity to face their worst nightmares and learn from them.  The lessons learned then become the basis for new decisions, decisions which alter our actions the next time we encounter the same nightmare.  Every decision you make changes the world around you.  Are you making it a better place?  Better for who?"

"Had so many thoughts last night and I don't know where to begin. Caught the last few minutes of Buffy but was really more excited with catching Charmed. I wasn't disappointed.   I loved the whole plot of the ability to change one's present by asking the future. It's something I have constantly thought of. Me wondering where I'd be in X no. of years. What to do in case I end up being poor and lonely or something like that. Back to Charmed, it's good to see Paige is getting the hang of her orbing thing. I can't wait till these girls get really uber powerful. :)  Then it was off to chatting with my honey. We had a mini discussion on how we are different when it comes to dealing with people for the first time. He said that he would want to get to know a person through \"prying\". (of course I'm sure he didn't mean for it to sound so negative) I, on the other hand, would listen to people converse (if I'm in a group). I want to get to know how people think, how their minds work. I get to know about that by listening to them speak. What words they use. What gestures they make (if they even make gestures... usually they'd be gay if they do hehehehe).  We proceeded to him asking me why I sing. At first I thought it was a simple question with a simple answer. But when I thought about it later on, it was so much more than that... it was as if I was asked why I breathe. I sing because it is in my nature. I was born with it. It is me. It's not just a talent I was fortunate enough to have, it is me. I derive pleasure from hearing my voice when I hit long lines from a Mendelssohn piece or doing runs from Handel's Messiah. I am enthralled at how people gain much satisfaction from hearing me sing. I like it when I entertain people.   I got to watch Oprah last night and was surprised that Cher was the guest. I was struck with the words she uttered. She said something about what she feels and what she likes about her job... her life. She said something like, she enjoys performing in front of people because she feels like she's a minister in front of her audience, her flock. She gets to be in that moment where she can feel every emotion from each audience member. She's able to impart feelings of comfort through her songs to her audience. And then I thought, that's exactly what it is. It's the ability to be in the moment and know that you have touched someone's life or a group of lives. You have shown the audience emotions through song/s."
"Damn. Lowlights of my day (so far): Marshall woke up EXTREMELY grumpy so we argued FIRST thing out of bed. My bosses wife DID not go into labor, which means I have a 3 o'clock meeting with him and can't leave early even though I have to get up at 3:00am for my flight tomorrow. (this will switch to a highlight should his wife go into labor soon).  Highlight of my day (so far): I made it to work on minimal gas."

"It is so quiet here today. I have had 2 granddaughters with me all week. They went home last night. They have been a BIG help to me the last 3 days. I thank God for them. They helped me get things together for a yard sale. They also helped me get things together to go camping. Without them, there would of been no way I could of gotten these things done. Praise the Lord for grandkids. I should of had them first!! Just kidding. My kids are great too. They are just working most of the time.  A friend of the family passed away Tues. evening. He was about 60yrs. old. He wasn't sick or anything. Someone found him dead in the bathroom. It was a shock. Here one minute and gone the next minute. To my knowledge, he wasn't saved. I haven't talked to him in awhile so hopefully he gave his life to the Lord and I don't know it. We never know from one minute till the next what is going to happen.   I am without wheels again. My van got sick yesterday. The water pump went out of it. I got to Bible study and that is as far as I got. I had to get a ride back home. So looks like I am stuck home for awhile.   Sunday evening, LaVerne and Edith Tripp will be at my church at 6:30pm. I am excited. They play that&nbsp;TWANG DITTY music!!&nbsp;There are several people I have invited that are coming. Some even from Frankfort, Ind. I even think my husband is going!&nbsp;People will go to&nbsp;something like that who won't go to \"church\".

"Today I went to see the movie Bad Santa. It was good! I was impressed! Movies like this one show all the funny parts on commercials, but there was funny-ass stuff. After seeing this film, it made me realize why its R. Billy Bob Thornton was great! So was the kid in the movie.  Why Its R - Holly shit, theres a bunch of dirty crap in this movie. He works at the mall as Santa Claus, goes to work totally drunk, gets pissed on by kids, curses every friggin second, has sex in a Nordstrum changing room, steals a BMW, and gets a lady pined up to a pinball machine and proceeds to hump her. Okay, must I go any further?   Acting - Billy Bob Thornton was great! He was THE person to do this film. For the only few films Ive seen him in, I had nothing bad to say. His a real good actor. As for the kid (who was chubby, talkative, and made fun of) he was good.  It was a sort of a clash. I mean, heres a drunk loser who dresses as Santa Claus living with a little fat kid who gets on his nerve all of the time. Not to mention Billy Bobs character hates kids. It was a funny combination.   My Grade - Well, its kinda hard to decide, so, I give it ****. It was very good! If you like movies like Old School or Saving Silverman, youll like this one! Go and see it while its still in theaters!"

"urlLink        Your Seduction Stye: \"Sex Pot\"  Tradionally known as a \"siren\", \"rake\", or \"femme fatale.\" You exude sensuality.   And while your sexiness is part of what makes you an incredible seducer...   Your ability to make others feel sexy is what really makes your seduction skills shine.     Most people don't feel attractive or desired enough - a need which you tap into.   You have the ultimate sex appeal, and getting attention from you is a total self esteem boost.   Your confidence is contagious, and you help others unleash their own sexuality.     Your sex pot seduction skills are so intoxicating that you can get away with... well, almost murder.   Lovers feel like your sensuality is in your blood, so it's only natural if you flirt a little.

"Echers World:  Issue 1: Part 1  The Dungeon (Schitzs realm)   We see a boy hunched over a desk at the end of the room. Hes atop a stool facing the wall a foot in front of him. The concrete floor is covered by a Persian rug. At the foot of the stool lays his backpack. To his right, there is a stereo blaring right Rob Zombie. On all the walls and the ceiling there are pipes. To his left, there are three filing cabinets. The surface hes writing on is covered in pens. Hes taped up a little sign on the plaster wall in front of him that says, Welcome to the Dungeon. On the shelf above him are towers of toilet paper. In places all over the ceiling the plaster is peeling off revealing the wooden boards. The room or dungeon is lighted by fluorescents, giving an eerie bleached feeling. We get closer to him so he takes up the whole frame. His arms are working feverishly. We see his eyes formed into slits. We see rapid hand movements across a piece of paper. The point of a pen scribbling lines of black ink we cant quite make out yet. We see the finished masterpiece. It is a bunny in a straight jacket with horns growing out of its head. We cut to the boys smiling face, hes excited. He sets his pen down as if to do a few touch ups.   Aidan,   Yes, turning to look at the maker of the sound. Then looks back at the picture. When he turned he drew a line across the picture, ruining it.   Fuck, he said quietly.   What?   Nothing Mom.   You look bored.   I am bored.   Why dont you come upstairs and work at the desk?   Imagination: Aidan sitting behind the behind the counter of the bookstore upstairs. A man walks up.

"It's summertime in Jersey, and the streets are awash in talent.  Maybe it's because i'm single again, but everywhere I look there are gorgeous women.  Walking down Bath Street in the lunch hour turned into a Miss World Beauty Pagent.  Brickies and plumbers in vans mowing down grannies because they are rubber-necking and not paying attention to driving.    A stunning brunette was walking past me, and she had a arse like two midgets on a fucking trampoline.  Before I knew it, I was on autopilot and on a direct course into a perfumerie. Luckily I snapped out of it before with only seconds to spare.  The problem is, this is Jersey.  Home of some of the most egotistical, gold-digging, drama queens this side of a Prada convention.  What every man wants is the perfect combination of a woman with a great body and a IQ over 14. So I have devised these simple tests to make sure that your potential girlfriend isn't too Jersey for you:    When she is asleep, insert a small tyre pressure gauge into her ear. If it reads over 20psi, get the fuck out.   Buy a normal, medium sized bucket from a DIY store. In freezer marker, write \"Versace\" down one side. Leave it near the hat stand. If she wears it, get the fuck out.   Glue a pound coin to her driveway.  Retire to a safe distance.  If she spends over 20 seconds attemping to remove it, or employes the use of any kind of crowbar, get the fuck out.   Over three flicks of her hair a minute, get the fuck out.   Check her CD collection. Anything related to Pop Idol, get the fuck out.  It's not worth the risk."
"Happy day after earth day   Another gem from the red box this morning: JUST A note to everyone involved in today's 20-Minute Toronto Makeover, especially where children may be participating: I found a condom outside the fire station at Regent and Dundas streets yesterday morning on my way to work. This is close to Regent Park School in Ward 28. Many of you in downtown wards are familiar with the Harm Reduction Programs we have in our neighbourhoods and know condoms, needles and crack pipes are all over the area. Please use extra care when cleaning your neighbourhoods. Gloves are vital and children participating should only do so with strict supervision. The condom I found was a pretty purple and children could mistake it for a balloon. Have fun cleaning.   Linda Dixon   (It's a dirty job, but ...) Pretty Purple Prophylactics.  Yes.  Safety first.  This is a real pickle here isn't it?  We want everyone to be safe.  We don't want anyone picking up condoms and needles.  My God, if you find one just mark where it is (put something over it so no one else will mistake it) and call the City's Solid Waste Management Hotline at 416-338-2010.  Don't let children pick up litter by themselves, and use your own common sense.  There's another side to this though.  Being safe, and watching for dangers is just part of the human condition.  But at what point will people simply not participate because the perceived risks are too high?  The above letter from a Sun reader is very anecdotal.  She saw a condom!  The implication (and in so many words) are that the area is a minefield of pestilence covered with \"condoms, needles and crack pipes\" like a playground in some after-school special.  The logic goes something like this: I think the City is dirty;  I have an  urlLink opportunity  to help clean it up;  Pardon?  You saw a condom?;   There's no way I'm going to participate because my health is much more valuable then a clean city. I'm so glad that SO  urlLink many people  are going  urlLink to participate  in this 20 minute  urlLink clean up , but if \"condoms\" and \"needles\" are going to be an excuse for not participating then we just go back to square one, where everyone complains, but no one is willing to do anything.  The attitudes of the residents of this city have changed so dramatically from last year to this.  People are very interested in helping out, people seem less likely to simply blame city hall because they can see garbage outside.  Honestly, it's a very promising attitude and I hope it stays with us.  Taking responsibility for, nay, even  acknowledging  our own garbage is a step in the right direction.  I hope everyone reading this will take a few minutes and tidy up an area they feel is unsightly.  If you feel it's too much for you, then please at least call 39-CLEAN and let the city know where you see litter."

"Elton at Radio City Music Hall   Yesterday's Radio City Music Hall Elton John gala is described thusly by the merry few at  urlLink Fashionweekdaily :  \"Tuesday night, it was all about  urlLink Elton . The concert opened with the music man seated at his piano on stage with an impressive 99-piece symphony orchestra and 62-voiced choir assembled behind him. John, dressed in a black suit with floral embellishments on the right sleeve, performed for over two hours to a packed audience that included such New York luminaries as Cynthia and Dan Lufkin, Eva Dillon, Bettina Zilkha, Howard Sobel, Amanda Hearst, Lauren, Sharon, and Ashley Bush.\"  The very cool  urlLink David Patrick Columbia gets existential in NY Social Diary :  \"Throughout the 70s as I was already grown up, but coming of age, the Elton John songs served as commentary, background, emotional reflections of that time, my age, our age. I never tired of him, of his delivery, his style; never tired of any of his material, especially those songs through the 1970s. When everything went CD, I started collecting him all over again.  \"Last night at Radio City Hall, I saw him (playing to a packed house) for the first time live in concert at a benefit he did for the Royal Academy of Music (where he was a scholarship student) and the Juilliard School of Music at Lincoln Center. He was accompanied by his band and the symphony orchestras of both schools. And he played and played and played. Tirelessly, he took us through a selection of his vast library of work. After forty-three years of performing all over the world 55 times at Madison Square Garden, this is his first time at Radio City Music Hall. (He has four more shows there through the weekend).   \"It was a rich evening for this writer, wrapped in the memories of growing up with Elton John?s songs.\""
"Bush wants to close book on library flap  By John Kennedy Sentinel Staff Writer  February 2, 2003  Not long before it was revealed that Gov. Jeb Bush planned to close the Florida State Library, lay off the entire staff and move the collection to Florida State University, the governor issued a proclamation declaring February as Florida Library Appreciation Month.  Bush, who has said promotion of reading is a top priority of his second term, wants to shut down the state's main library and move almost 1 million books and historical items, including 16th-century maps, early documents on Walt Disney World and some of the oldest photos of Florida.  The budget-cutting move has drawn fire, and even FSU said it doesn't have space or money to house the items.  Parts of FSU's own collection are in warehouses, and the university wouldn't get any more money or staff to deal with the new collections.  Told last week that the flap doesn't seem to be going away, Bush answered, \"So, stop writing about it.\"  The governor's proclamation praised the importance of libraries and said the month is \"to encourage recognition of all of our Florida libraries that provide outstanding service to our communities.\"  Good thing he didn't proclaim \"Florida Library Year.\"  Copyright  2003, Orlando Sentinel"

"While I know some have suggested that I not post anything printed in The State Press, I am going to post my most recent column...deal with it.    Tillman not Arizona's only hero  By John Ronquillo Published: Tuesday, April 27, 2004    Raymond Losano, Benjamin Biskie, Jay Aubin, Alyssa Peterson, and Nathan White.   Few of us recognize the names of these people who felt inside themselves a burning to defend our country. They are Arizona soldiers who have paid the ultimate price to ensure our freedom and are heroes in their own right who gave their lives in either Afghanistan or Iraq, fighting in battles that have raged for more than a year.   As the news of each new casualty came, our hearts sank a little bit deeper as the war escalated.   The news of Pat Tillman's death has spread faster than you can bat an eyelash, and in just four days, every TV news media outlet -- from CNN to MTV -- has covered the story. Nearly every paper has printed an image of the soldier with piercing eyes and a square jaw carrying the American flag, an image most of us will never forget.   The death of Arizona's favorite strong safety-turned-Army Ranger has drawn tears from fans and admirers while garnering a huge media response -- something I'm sure Tillman would hate.   Growing up in Arizona, I have learned of many war heroes such as Frank Luke and Ira Hayes, and I've listened to my grandfathers tell me war stories of Pearl Harbor and fighting in India, Burma and China.   While there is only one Pat Tillman, some of us are failing to realize that there are many who have gone before him and many yet to follow who have the same qualities: honor, pride, integrity and humility. We have all grown to appreciate his diligence and humility and the way he quietly left the sidelines of Sun Devil Stadium to join the front lines of the war on terrorism.   While we greatly admire the sacrifice Tillman made, many others have led or followed in the same manner without the media attention. And in some cases, it's been the media attention that has drawn our focus away from what is really important: honoring those who have defended us.   The numerous eulogies in honor of Tillman have called for monuments and various sites to be named after him, and in some form or another, it will be done. The numbers he wore will be retired, and the plaza surrounding the new Cardinals stadium, scheduled to open in 2006 in Glendale, will be named \"Pat Tillman Freedom Plaza.\"   In contrast, the tributes to Pfc. Lori Piestewa, were not as welcome. Arizona state Route 51 was renamed the \"Piestewa Freeway,\" and Squaw Peak was renamed \"Piestewa Peak\" after the soldier, who was killed last year in Iraq.   This change did not come without an outcry of opposition. Was it so hard to name a stretch of asphalt and concrete, and a small mountain previously labeled with a word offensive to some Native Americans after Piestewa?   It is only right to honor all who have laid down their lives, no matter the circumstance. Pat Tillman walked away from his family, his friends and millions of dollars for what he thought was right, and he did it quietly.   It is said that Army Rangers fight like lions and soar like eagles. Pat Tillman exemplified that. He stands out because other people identified with him. He was humble and reclusive by his own choice. Let us honor Tillman in the true fashion that he would have shown, by honoring all of those who have given their lives to protect ours.   To the soldiers who have given your lives: we mourn for you all."
"Here's Rick's latest essay from London. He's on assignment there for a technology and communications company.    Smile!   12/7/01 London   It would be a delicious irony to find a security camera trained on George Orwell's grave in Oxfordshire.  The sunken little grassy plot in Sutton Courtenay Churchyard may be one of the last places in England without closed circuit TV surveillance.  Even Orwell said the things he described in \"1984\" and other writings \"could happen.\"  Some of them have.  Big Brother is on every busy street in the places where pickpockets and other footpads flourish.  There are at least two cameras aboard every big red double-decker bus, and presumably an onboard videotape recorder.  Our own smallish office has ten.  They're in a smoked glass dome on the convenience store ceiling.  Alert shopkeepers with walkie-talkies can track a fast-moving picaroon down the block like radar, and the CCTV tapes will have him slapped in the Tower of London before he can say \"Miranda.\"  It didn't occur to me to expect this in London, and it was quite awhile before I even noticed it.  But the British market for CCTV systems was 250 million last year.  One shopping center alone is said to have 700 cameras, and security people to watch them.  \"The UK's CCTV market is very advanced and mature compared with those of other countries,\" crows an industry Website.  \"It enjoyed a boom in the mid-1990s, when many large city-centre surveillance schemes were set up.\"  (The word \"scheme\" doesn't have the pejorative connotation here that it does in the U.S.)  The government is foursquare behind all this, and in fact, responsible for a lot of it.  The current round of Home Office grants for community CCTV security systems will distribute 108 million to set up thousands of new cameras.  It's no surprise that present-day watchdogs find this to be positively Orwellian.  A civil liberties group running the Website www.spy.org.uk is campaigning for the enactment of rules for the proper use of spy cameras.  They cite, for example, the case of a man who attempted suicide in front of a surveillance camera.  The tape later found its way onto a TV show, to the horror of his relatives.  The government says the cameras serve as an extra pair of eyes to protect the public.  Opponents wonder whose eyes, what they're watching, and what happens to the information they gather.  Orwell wrote, \"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face?forever.\"   England today seems far too civilized for that kind of thing, but he may have been prescient about the role of pictures in post-1984 society.  Big Brother, thy name is Alan Funt.  -- Rick"

"\"Alright Brain, you don't like me, and I don't like you. But lets just do this, and I can get back to killing you with beer. \"-Homer J. Simpson         Funny isn't it? How summer is so anticipated, and when it arrives, its pure un-concentrated bliss? Yes but it goes to fast and you feel like it was cut short, just short of satisfying. Anyway I think I'll just skip the whole clever writing piece and say it. Summer's hard-core and rules but it's too damn short. School, is not hard core, its horrible and too long. Burn the schools rise up and burn them all, or just fake sick or play some \"hockey\" (hookey you numb nuts) Well I'm going to go try and make something of this boring summer day, later...rock on. Actually no, I think I'll stay and write something or paste a good song in here. Yeah so here's a kickass song- Tribute:    This is the greatest and best song in the world... Tribute.   Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,  we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.  All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon... in the middle... of the road.  And he said:  [sung]  \"Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul.\" (soul) [spoken]  Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,  and we each said... \"Okay.\"  [sung]  And we played the first thing that came to our heads,  Just so happened to be,  The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.   Look into my eyes and it's easy to see  One and one make two, two and one make three,  It was destiny.  Once every hundred-thousand years or so,  When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow  And the grass doth grow...   Needless to say, the beast was stunned.  Whip-crack went his schwumpy tail,  And the beast was done.  He asked us: \"(snort) Be you angels?\"  And we said, \"Nay. We are but men.\"  Rock!  Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,  Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!   This is not The Greatest Song in the World, no.  This is just a tribute.  Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World, no, no.  This is a tribute, oh, to The Greatest Song in the World,  All right! It was The Greatest Song in the World,  All right! It was the best muthafuckin' song the greatest song in the world.  [2-part skat]  [spoken]  And the peculiar thing is this my friends:  the song we sang on that fateful night it didn't actually sound  anything like this song.  [sung]  This is just a tribute! You gotta believe me!  And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.  Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',  So surprised to find you can't stop it.  [skat]  All right! All right!"
"Plain  It has been a concern of mine for a long time. Chocolate is a flavour, so is Caramel, but Vanilla is labelled as plain. This is a travesty of justice. How dare we do vanilla such a disservice. I demand reparations for the damages done. Vanilla ice cream is not plain ice cream. It's not as if chocolate is vanilla ice cream with chocolate added to it IS IT!? NO! Raa. Vanilla is a flavour in it's own right. And it is my favourite flavour. So don't anyone dare be calling it plain. There is nothing like freshly extruded vanilla ice cream. Mmmm. And by the way. Hokey Pokey ice cream is  not  vanilla flavoured ice cream with bits of junk in it. No. It's hokey pokey flavoured. Raaa and don't you forget it.   Jobs  I am looking at finding another job. I'll keep you posted.   Time for Men to Lead  I am heartened to see young men in our church starting to take things seriously. The lack of male leadership in  the church  today is something I am really concerned about. And by  the church  I mean the church in the Western world.  A side issue is the lack of male leadership in the family. What does please me though is a number of guys I have talked to lately wanting to do something about it, but not only wanting to, they are doing things about it.  Great."

"... to be in right now. It's a moment of high satisfaction... a brilliant flash of contentment in what is already a profoundly happy existence.  That's a lot of blabber to say mainly that I have this intense and somewhat inexplicable feeling of contentment today.   Part of the reason is having the day off... I'm sure of that. Part of the reason is also that empty and clean apartment that I've talked about for days here; part of it is also the long, uninterrupted stretches of Proust that I've enjoyed last night and today; there's also the 10 hours of sleep last night-- almost unheard of for me.  Well, I could go on... but there it is. I'm where I want to be- in my favorite coffee shop, with my books around me, my phone and my PDA in their precise positions on the table in front of me.  Maybe I'm a control freak about these small things. It might be some weird but benign manifestation of obsessive-compulsive disorder, I don't know. But in the absence of Dave, I find a great deal of enjoyment and even a certain measure of comfort in creating a precise order around me.  It could be that I'm trying to make up for a distinct lack of order in some other part of my life; or I'm trying to cover up a part of me that's extremely dissatisfied. Now, I happen to think the latter isn't true with me. But maybe there's some truth in the former. I think the feeling that we lack control in one or more parts of our life causes us to be even more careful with the rest of ourselves. Or this is my theory.  But I also think there's a part of me that likes everything in its place... perfectly arranged... giving the impression of having been undisturbed. I think I would be truly impossible to live with if there weren't a part of me that also welcomed chaos and uncertainty. Those are the warring factions of my life. For the moment, order has the upper hand.  I went with three friends for Indian food last night. We went to my favorite Indian restaurant in town and I ordered my standard meal: onion salad, garlic naan and  dal tarka - the tasty combination of lentils, garlic, ginger and other spices.  Now I always order it \"hot.\" But last night it was  hot . As my friend Matt says, it's the kind of heat that makes you cry but makes you want to eat more. And eat I did! Every bit of it. I weighed 1.6 lbs heavier today at the gym... and I know exactly what it is... rice and a heap of  dal tarka .  The onion salad is a special indulgence-- albeit a rare one. The onion salad is literally sliced, raw onions, with a few cucumber and tomato wedges, sprinkled with lime and cilantro.  Raw onions have many health benefits-- antioxidant properties, B vitamins, they're anti-mucosal and they have anti-septic properties. I'm also keenly aware of their anti-people properties. But a long, determined swishing of Listerine this morning followed by sustained brushing seems to have eradicated the onion breath. Still, when I got in the shower after the workout, the steam rising from the water as it hit my body had the faint odor of... onions. I don't mind... I love onions and garlic. But I try to think of others-- others I might encounter during the day- not others who might be in the shower with me. :) I was showering alone.   In fact, I've been showering alone a lot lately, so to speak. For a long time now, I've not wanted sex. I've been in this space where, when it's been available, sex has seemed like a burden. Not that I'm a slut, but this is a new feeling for me. I've never been highly sexed, but I've always enjoyed sex and usually I'd find an excuse to have some every couple weeks. But that's not where I am these days, I guess.  This is probably a good thing because I'm not dating or involved with anyone right now. So any sex I would be having would some anonymous hookup... or with a friend who probably began as an anonymous hookup. I'm not against the anonymous hookup... as long as we've covered all the relevant safety issues.  I've listened to many people denounce the hookup as an intensely demeaning experience. They say we're making the act of sex a cheap trick; that we don't understand the true meaning and passion of the sexual experience-- which we could never experience in a hookup; that, leaving aside the physical satisfaction, we're abusing our psychological self.  Usually when someone launches into this argument, I stay silent. First of all, because they usually go on for a very long time. And second, because I don't entirely disagree with them. I think for some people, it is a demeaning and psychologically damaging experience. These people feel empty and awful afterward because of what they've done.  Personally, I've never felt that way. I don't think it's because I'm totally lacking in personal awareness. I think it might be because I have a strong sense of myself; or maybe it's because when I have hooked up, I've known exactly why I was doing it and what I should and should not expect from the experience. Or it might be some other reason."
"I think I have to stick up for us americans here.  This is (could be, who knows) an actual letter sent to a man named Ryan  DeVries by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, State of  Michigan.   Wait till you read this guy's response!   SUBJECT: DEQ File No.97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec.  20; Montcalm County Dear  Mr.  DeVries:   It has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that  there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of  property.  You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor  who did the following unauthorized activity:   Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream  of Spring Pond.   A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.  A  review of the department's files shows that no permits have been issued.  Therefore, the department has determined that this activity is in violation  of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and  Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being  sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compile Laws, annotated.   The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially  failed during a recent rain event, causing debris and flooding at downstream  locations.  We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and  cannot be permitted.  The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist  all activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow  condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the stream  channel.   All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 2002.   Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a  follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff.  Failure to comply  with this request or any further unauthorized activity on the site may result  in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action.  We anticipate  and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter.   Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions.   Sincerely, David L.  Price, District Representative Land and Water Management  Division ___________________________________________________   This is the actual response sent back:   Re: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec.  20; Montcalm County.   Dear Mr.  Price,   Your certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to.  I am the legal landowner but not the Contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson,  Michigan.  A couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of  constructing and maintaining two wood \"debris\" dams across the outlet stream  of my Spring Pond.  While I did not pay for, authorize, nor supervise their  dam project, I think they would be highly offended that you call their  skillful use of nature building materials \"debris.\" I would like to challenge  your department to attempt to emulate their dam project any time and/or any  place you choose.  I believe I can safely state there is no way you could  ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity,  their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.   As to your request, I do not think the beavers are aware that they must first  fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity.  My first dam question to you is:   (1) Are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers?  or, (2)  do you require all beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam  request?   If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, through the  Freedom of Information Act, I request completed copies of all those other  applicable beaver dam permits that have been issued.  Perhaps we will see if  there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the  Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the PublicActs  of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws,  annotated.   I have several concerns.  My first concern is - aren't the beavers entitled  to legal representation?  The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute  and are unable to pay for said representation- so the State will have to  provide them with a dam lawyer.  The Department's dam concern that either one  or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing flooding is  proof that this is a natural ccurrence, which the Department is required to  protect.   In other words, we should leave the Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than  harass them and call their dam names.  If you want the stream \"restored\"to a  dam free-flow condition please contact the beavers, but if you are going to  arrest them, they obviously did not pay any attention to your dam letter;  they being unable to read English."
"Had a really long dream last night. I dreamt that I had to go to some European country for work. When I reached there I went to the seaside, there was a waterfall near the shore and I started taking pictures of it. After that I was at some apartment with my boss and another colleague, and we started talking. Then it was time for us to go back to Singapore so we left the house and got ready to take the cab to the airport, but then I remembered I forgot my bag. They waited for me while i headed back, but I couldn't find the apartment that I was in, so finally they left without me to the airport. Can't remember anything after that.  Coincidentally two of my colleagues are overseas right now. Heh I think it's probably a manifestation of my desire to join them.   I read that Saddam's relatives claim he was sedated before he was taken in which was why he didnt resist when they found him in the hole. But I am wondering how is that possible, did they like throw sedatives and a syringe into the hole and asked him to inject himself ? Or filled the hole with sleeping gas before they dragged him out?  Doesn't sound plausible."

"There is a very good article by  urlLink Sucheta Dalal in The Financial Express .  Recounting the experience in USA where unscrupulous power distribution companies (starting with Enron, but not restricted to only them), she shows how these companies manipulated the power distribution and raken in excess cash from poor, unsuspecting people.  She also shows some problems in Mumbai where the power distribution is managed by Reliance Energy and Tata Power.  As of now, power distribution is in private hands only in Mumbai and has just recently been introduced in Delhi. Reports indicate that things have considerably improved in Delhi, though there have been several complaints as well in terms of billing discrepancies and collection methods as well as dealing with complaints.  A very strong regulator is required to manage the prices when private power distribution companies come into the picture. More competition would/should help in keeping off illegal operation by power distributors as in the case of USA.

"Hmmmm.I really dont have much to say tonight. Its all either boring, work related orwell something Im just not going to share.

If you want to read some of my work related stories check out the link to Flying the Silly Skies, I swear they are all true stories. Anyway Wow! Now I am really fascinated by this storm. No lightening, bummer, but it is windy as all get out, my window is shaking and I can see the pine trees whipping about in the wind. It takes so little to fascinate me, it is kind of sad really. Maybe its like one of those Zen riddles you know if a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it does it make a sound? (Wow! Lighting! No thunder though.) It is supposed to get your mind in a state of readiness. Readiness for what Id like to know. I think storms have that effect on me. If I just knew what I was getting ready for Oh well I think Im just going to be fascinated by the storm for the rest of the night; I just need to pick some good music"
"So I got home late enough last night to fold laundry and catch  urlLink Average Joe 2: Hawaii .  I kinda liked the first Average Joe -- what little I caught of it -- because the \"hot\" guys weren't oh-my-god hot, and they clearly didn't see themselves in Darwinian proportions.  But the \"hot\" guys on Average Joe 2 -- though some of them are pretty amazing to behold -- are assholes.  They're clearly arrogant and competitive and filled with a disturbing glee over the prospect of hurting the unattractive guys -- which is something they probably already get to do (glee or not) every moment of their not-on-TV lives.    I wonder where they get this need to behave like vicious junior-high-school girls -- proudly recorded on camera, no less.

"the rest of my life to go now without a cigarette.  Today wasn't so hard to quit.  I went to the Asian Film Festival out in San Jose and saw some Asian-American directed films.  That was quite an artsy fartsy experience that I will probably never forget.  The shit that I saw was pretty boring except for this one cartoon clip which was quite interesting.  The rest of it was pretty dark and there was a real depressing overtone to each film.  The theme of the films were Shadows and Light though.  If the sadness & depression is represented by the shadows, then I guess having hope would be the light that casts the shadows down onto its surface.  The underlying value for these movies is hard to catch, but I would say that peace is the most prominent value that the movie authors wanted to portray within their films.  Peace between man & woman, between each others cultures, and amoungst ourselves within our cultures as well.  War is something that we would be better off without.  But nature is embedded in us and madness is written within our genetic code.  Have we forgotten that we are a part of nature?  I am aware of it.  I am trying to live with my desires parallel to my destiny.  What I am destined for is going to find me and nature is going to determine whether I receive my blessings or not.  The thing is ... I think that sometimes I forget about nature and I turn into a machine processing data in 0's and 1's.  Seeing the world as good and bad, wrong and right, heaven and hell, the God & the Devil.  Bipolarizing my views and narrowing it down to this or that.  You can get with this or you can get with that.  You can get with this or you can get with that.  You can get with this or you can get with that.  I think you'll get with this cause this is where it's at.  Ah man.  The girl from my school was busy this weekend so I was unable to see her.  I want to buddy up with her for this school project we got going on.  I want to write up a business & marketing plan for my music industry class.  On top of the songs I record as well.  I don't count the songs as the project.  But the business plan is actual work, so I think it'd be wise to take care of that.  This girl is super hot though.  I mean, it's not just the physical side of it that gets me.  She's real opinionated and speaks very passionately about how she feels about everything and I think that's real attractive.  I want to be able to hang out with her more often, but I'm not trying to make myself look too eager.  Can't chase the cat away.  I gotta look the other way until she comes around and needs attention.  Yes, I believe that guys are like dogs and ladies are like cats.  But, I can't think about her too much.  Because when I get to doing that shit, it goes all fucked up and I end up screwing up what could've been a good friendship.  So, I'm trying to be less selfish, not think about how hot she is, and focus more on how I could be a friend to her rather than get my hand on her tatas.  I quit smoking, so I can exercise more again.  I have been going only twice a week.  I want to bump that back up to three times a week and do more cardio so that I could have more energy during the daytime.  I want to change my sleep schedule so that I can wake up without being so tired during the weekdays.  So, I plan on waking up at 6AM this week and working out during the morningtime versus working out in the evening because that makes it hard to sleep.  So, I need the strength to do this for myself.  It will improve my life and make me a better person for the people that I care about.  They'll know a Doug that gets better and better.  In God's image, of course.  Whatever the fuck that means?  Actually, I'm not living God's image like Ned Flanders.  I'm turning into an artsy fartsy, post-modernistic, techno junkie.  I've fallen victim to Diesel jeans fashion and feminism.  Metrosexuality is like the epitome of slavery, consumerism, and sadomasochism mixed up in a blender to make the most fucked up Jamba Juice you've ever tasted.  Bitter as fuck without any sweetness.  Tart like orange peels and nasty like smoking dried up banana peels to try to get high off of.  This is the Jamba Juice of my life.  Drink it and suffer along with me God damn it."

And normalacy is so over-rated, anyway, so that could be a compliment.   Man, I know three Jerrys, one is a dick from the best that I ken, one is a rocker and consequently, my ultimate idol, and the last is a gay guy who gives a mean haircut and can draw Tina Turner like snapping his fingers. (random)  So suddenly I realize I'm not going to be there for the speeches...I beg your pardon! But it's ok, I'll get Rob and Alex and Julian to start up the chant without me. And I'll be around Thursday so my vote's in. Speeches are about the best part of the year, and here I am about to miss it. Talk about guns, prostitutes, and violence that need to be eliminated, that'll get their attention. And if not you can go J. Edwards and preach damnation. I know watching that happen would get me going.  Jesus, I need a vacation. Fair night, all."
"several things. . . . .   one:  I am done. I only have a few more things to do before I trundle down an aisle in Queen's Jock Harty arena and grab my piece of paper that says I learn stuff  good. My last class of all time was today. I did not attend, besides, I haven't gone to it since the beginning of January so I figured why start now?  Besides, I went out drinking last night and damned if I was getting up for a ten o'clock class.  hotel work countdown: 9 days 'till sweet succulent freedom  To celebrate ending the school year and school career, my housemate and I are having a huge kegger at our apartment. It's going to be so much fun. I'm getting my band together and we're going to do an acoustic set at the  beginning. In a related story, my friend Grant wants Unibrau to play his house party at the end of April. He and his housemates are moving out but have the place until May 1st, so, they are going to have a huge bash in an empty place. We just need to set up our equipment in the living room and rock out until we can rock no more.    two: the Super Friendz have reformed! This is some of the most exciting news that I have come across in a long time. They were a staple band for me in my high school days and continue to bring me great joy as I advance the years. Their first album \"Mock Up, Scale Down\" is very choice. If you have the means I highly recommend getting yourself a copy wherever you can find one.   three: Everything I seem to touch these past few weeks either turns to Shit or Shitestra(the low-cal, low-fat Shit substitute for a non-sodium diet). I don't know how the cosmic forces have aligned against me but I just hope that  the whim of Providence turns its gaze elsewhere soon. Or I just have to  stop making stupid stupid decisions while out in public.  four: My band played Clark Hall Pub (opening up for a great band called \"Horse and Mule\" - it was their last show ever and the are far too  talented to let us open for them) on Wednesday night and it was a great show. Sadly there was no table to mount for a Triumphant Guitar Solo of Immense Rock Power (a la the Queen's Pub shows) but I made do by wearing a gaudy hawaiian shirt and a gaudier (sp?) sombrero. You don't mess with a sombrero. That's a rule in my book.  Anyhow, we played loud (and partially good) and there came a point  where I cut my hand on the strings during the third last song. I didn't realise this until the end of the song when I looked down and  saw that there was a lot of blood on my guitar.  Normally this would startle me, but I was so full of adrenaline that  it just fueled the rest of my performance. The free beer they provided to us helped to steady the nerves. Now my guitar has a few extra splashes of red on its pick guard and I have no real intention of cleaning it off for  the time being. I think it looks kinda cool.  It's not often that you can leave a little piece of yourself in a campus pub.  As for the free beer, by the end of the night we had completely taken advantage of the Clark Hall staff's generosity.  The final total of pitchers consumed by Unibrau: 8 Number of members in Unibrau: 4 It was a good time.  The ending of the night was crap, but that can be filed under item three (as seen above)   I just need to bunker down and let the crap times pass.    five: why is it snowing? why why why why why why why?   blargh  ajc"

"Tonight was homecoming! Sooo much fun. We lost the games, but oh well. I got to see everyone, and it was just fun.  The dance was fun.

"Sleeping in my car(riage)   I love observing people on the mrt. It makes good fodder for enterainment and gives me something to write about. No prizes for guessing what I'm going to write about today. Yes, sleeping on the train. From experience, I can tell you that sleeping on the train is extremely uncomfortable. One can hardly find a good \"spot\" to lean against, unless one doesn't mind leaning against the oily glass at the sides. More often than not, people will usually lean back against back glass or keep their heads straight.   Deep in sleep, people will hardly realise what they are doing. So, occasionally, you'll get those who end up leaning precariously on one side, encroaching his/her neighbor's space. Their heads usually bob up and down and when they lean too far to one side, they'd automatically jerk back to position, only to start leaning once they've positioned themselves properly. I've encountered some of those people and depending on my mood, sometimes, I'd usually just let them lean against me. I can remember one incident where a plus-sized man was leaning against me. It was gross cos he was snoring at the same time. Haha.. i didn't know how to get him back into place without being rude. So what I did was to slowly nudge him upright with my body. Yeah, i pushed against him and he was startled by the sudden movement. With a nice little grunt, he sat upright and promptly fell asleep again.   People also sleep with their mouths open and sometimes snore. It's very interesting to observe them."

I talked to Dave on the phone yesterday, and I was happy to do so. However, since we weren't in my backyard until 3 o'clock in the morning, the conversation wasn't as fruitful as it coulda been.  I played golf with old men today, also with my brother. I lost. To one old man. I beat the other. Is... is that an accomplishment that I can say I beat an old man? Is it a disgrace to say that I lost to an old man? Is it more of a disgrace to admit that we played from the ladies' tees? Ha ha, Joe, if you're reading this: \"Poonanny!!!\" Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  I am going to teach Pam to play golf. Whether she likes it or not. And she probably won't (I mean, it's quality time with Sean- what should I expect?) , so I guess we're only gonna have like one lesson or so.  Do I ask too many rhetorical questions?  I had a weird dream about Sam the other night. We were gonna play softball, and there was no crowd (we were at Cypresswood/Collins Park) and she was scared to play because there was... no crowd. I was rather confused. No cereal dreams recently.  I have  got  to stop listening to Dashboard. I don't wanna be sick of them for my trip to Gulf Shores which is in not one, not three, but  two  days!!! Oh yeah!  I guess you can tell I'm pretty bored.

"Finally figured it out.  A couple of months ago the aerial antenna on my car vanished, leaving only the screw where it should have been.  I didn't notice it for a while, so I'm not sure how long it had been missing because I rarely listen to the radio in my car...the novelty of having a CD player hasn't worn off yet.  I told myself I'd head down to Lordco and pick up a replacement.  Never did.  Then, three weeks ago I noticed that the aerial was back!  Like, had someone borrowed it?!  Or had a random person decided to swap their old one and noticed that mine was missing?  So, I finally remembered to ask around and it turns out that my dad had replaced it about three months ago.  :)  Thanks Dad!  In other news:  I took my mom out for her birthday \"Death by Chocolate\" that I had never gotten around to doing with her.  Her b-day is in March, BTW.

I enjoyed having a whole day off.  :)  Tomorrow I will attempt to help no name yet and Mr. no name yet get their apartment painted before no name yet Jr. arrives.  I've never painted walls before.  I feel that I will probably be wearing an assortment of colours by the end of the day.  This pleases me.  I've always wanted to be various shades of greens and reds.  Plus it will be practice for when I buy my own place, hopefully in May.

"Mom: Sarah, how's your drinking situation? Me: It's alright mom. Haven't been drinking much at all lately. You were right, it's so great not to drink. Mom: Great! And how are the boys?

I have no idea how that got in there, but I was so super stoked to find it. I think the pill fairy (fairie?) dropped it in there during my less sober of days. My previous life.   Yesterday I had to stay home sick. Lizzy spent all of last week home ill and Vicki came over for like 5 hours on saturday and sunday and got really ill and the both of them wondered how i managed to stay alright. Tuesday night it hit me and I forced myself to stay home and recover. At night I got dragged out by my brother, Leight, Seth and Guilia to see  Love, Actually . I am still in love with Hugh Grant.  Afterwards I hussied up and went to meet up with the stunning 30's movie starlet urlLink Lindsay  at the Coral Room for what was supposed to be the White Stripes after party. They never showed up.

"Yesterday I flew back to Washington's [Reagan] National Airport from Seattle (via Phoenix).   Flying on September 11 was less of a big deal than I thought it would be.   There were three Phoenix police officers at the gate when I boarded my flight (presumably ethnically profiling oncoming passengers) and I think there may have been air marshals on the plane (several big crew-cut guys near the front of the plane).  Other than that, security was appallingly normal - I was able to get my Leatherman and shaving razor on in my carry-on without incident.    CNN, the airport terminal  Pravda , was playing September 11 retrospectives and terrorism news everywhere I went, so I couldn't stop thinking about that day.  I thought back to an embarrassing moment that day when I went to a high floor in Georgetown's law school library to try to see the Pentagon or smoke rising from it.  I realized when I got up there and saw what looked like smoke rising that I was trying to see a spectacle, when this was in fact an unimaginable disaster, and felt horribly guilty.   That memory returned to me as I watched CNN trot out all the memorial footage this September 11th and it will probably be what I remember the longest about that fateful day."
"was just reading through the lileks \"backfence\" column, and the board they have there.  one subject is bad smells.  i couldn't register to post for some reason, so here are some bad smells, and where they come from.   Number 1 on my list of bad smells is the tide flats here.  Ugh.  In the summer, to have a high tide in the early morning that retreats throughout the day until most of the flats are exposed, and there they sit and stink until the evening.  Oh. Ma. Gawd.  Its like having someone wave a diaper under your nose.  Over and over and over. Its only worse when there's a fog.  Because the fog seems to carry the smell its its foggy body.    Then there's the paper processing factory smell.  There used to be a paper plant in Gardner, about an hour north of here.  You had to go through Gardner to get further up the coast, where, i forget, past Reedsport i think.. whatever.  The smell was enough to take your breath away, and the little town of Gardner was almost literally across the highway.  There's a paper plant on the 5 on the way to Eugene, too..   Port of LA smell.  I don't know what this is.  Its a large conglomeration of smells.  Some parts of the port smell very petrochemichal.  Some parts reek of diesel dust.  Some parts smell like tidal flats, fish AND diesel fumes.  A large part of the smell is the refineries.  (For truly icky refinery smells, try Carson).  One road around the port, i believe its the Road to Nowhere, the Henry Ford Freeway, goes  through  the Arco refinery, or did, i don't know anymore.  But you'd be driving along, come alongside the refinery, and there would be, like  no air .  You'd squeak a few hitching breaths, hoping for some oxygen, but there wasn't any.  It was a scary smell, i guess.  Not even a smell, really.  A state of non-air.    Another local smell is the chip piles.  Sounds wonderful.. yes, it sounds like piles of hmm, buffalo chips or something, but it isn't, and actually, in small doses, it smells good.  The chip piles are at the docks in North Bend. They are towering piles of wood chips.  Fir and Cedar, i guess.  For some reason, when its cold out, those piles reek. Like straight Pine-Sol.  It burns your eyes to drive by them.    Now, for some good smells.  the chip piles are  a combination of good and bad.. so, nice segue, i guess.    Racing fuel.  Specifically the fuel used by the IMSA cars.  i dont know what this is... 105 octane or something, but i love the smell of it.  Just  remembering  the smell makes my heart pound.  Its vaguely sweet, very strong, pungent and not very burny smelling.    Dirt. Local dirt. The dirt in the woods.  i guess its loam.  The floor of the woods here is so packed with pine needles and moss that in some places, its springy.  and every footstep brings forth that wonderful damp piney smell.  It smells like mushrooms, like a blanket that was hung all day in a cedar tree.    Ocean.  This is weird, because there's only one ocean smell that smells really good.  i first experienced it in an incense by Airs, called, of all things, \"ocean\".  It smelled so good, i thought, i wonder what ocean this smells like?! Now i know.  Out by Empire there's a little spot called Fossil point.  At low tide, the good ocean smell sometimes emanates from here.  Some days, its the stinky tide flats smell, but others, oooh.  It's vaguely salty, and fresh but slightly musky.  If you're wondering, get some Airs \"ocean\" incense.    Really good pot has a smell all its own.  like oranges sort of. piney and orangey.    Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee has an unbeatable smell.  So does organic Kona. Having had both, i'm deeply disappointed by all other coffee now. Nothing comes close to either of those.  Kona reminds me of my friend John Porter, whom i still miss very, very much.  Maybe he'll google himself one day and find this.    New leather.  Nothing smells so good!   ok, i'm done."

"I have to get my wisdom teeth out tomorrow. *cringes* God, I know 90% of people in this country go through the same thing but I'm really scared. Any sane person wouldn't make a big deal out of this. Not me, I started fucking crying earlier. For some reason I have HUGE issues with the whole procedure. Everything about it is hideous. The fact that an IV needle is involved scares me even more. Isn't there just something freaky about having your body pumped full of drugs to make you lose consciousness? My wisdom teeth haven't even erupted yet, meaning that the surgeon has to saw through my gumline and jaw to get the teeth out... The *best* part is, this is in NO way a necessary procedure. The three teeth that are developing are coming in perfectly straight and have enough room. My orthodontist is just being an arse. Even my dentist said this wasn't needed but he seems to think he knows better. Fucking A... I may just run away, I don't need to waste my entire mid-winter break being puffy and in pain.   My parents seem to think I'm superior to other humans because I only grew three of the bloody things... Right, if I was more evolved I wouldn't have developed them at all. Would've saved myself a lot of pain. Anyway, Alice called me a few minutes ago to assure me that I wouldn't die. Like she knows anything.   I'm only 15, I'm to young for this.

"urlLink Speaking as a parent : \"Jake spent most of the month telling anyone who cared to listen that Santa Claus didn't exist.

"Yeah, I know.  It's been a while.  So here's the update, in case anyone still cares.  Steph, Jen, and I got our apartment.  We move in Sep 18.  I'm actually very excited and very scared at the same time.  I've never been on my own before!  Classes this summer are going good.  I'm very excited about all the stuff I will learn in my X-Ray classes.  I also feel that Physics will be a breeze.  Everything else in life is ok.  A friend of mine wrote in their diary that alot of \"scenes\" in her life are put to music.  She went on to explain that some \"scenes\" in life just didn't feel complete without music accompanying it.  When I look back on my life, at the point where I was a high school student in Orlando, I find myself agreeing.  In Orlando, I made some pretty special friends.  These friends were not just my ordinary friends.  They weren't even my best friends.  These were people who shaped me into the kind of person I am today.  They inspired me.  They cultured me.  They showed me \"the life\".  The one person I think that sticks out the most in that category would be Meghan.  Meghan is two years older than me, and for the most part, I hung out with her and her friends in high school.  I met her at my first job, and the friendship grew.  We would take weekend trips to the beach as often as possible with her crew.  We would have so much fun.  Fun I never knew existed.  Meg became like the big sister I never had.  She became my tour guide to life.  She balanced me.  As you can imagine, I was broken when we moved to Ohio and I had to leave her behind.  Anyways, getting back to my point.  I was driving along the other day and I popped in a CD that I had burned and had not listened to in a long time.  A song came on that provoked some serious emotions.  I almost broke down in tears.  The song was Shania Twain's \"Your Still The One\".  No matter how much you think this song sucks, this song always makes me quiver when i hear it.  Why?  This was a favorite song of ours to jam to on the way to the beach.  It reminds me of the better times.  It reminds me of my big sister that I've missed so much.  I can still visualize sitting in the backseat of her car as we drove to the beach, all occupants of the car singing along to Shania.  I can remember actually laughing and feeling care free.  Feeling  happy .  I hope this story finds you all well.  I plan on visiting my sis soon, perhaps in the autumn or winter.  Until then, take care of yourselves.  And listen to plenty of music."

"Who was really really drunk last night?  Well there are a lot of answers but my point is that my name is definitely one of them.  Last night turned out great.  I was late like bitch but after that stuff flew smoothly.  We ate some pork at WABA and then hung out at the Commune where we had some beer and icecream cake.  That icecream cake was awesome.  Whoever's idea that was needs a pat on the back.  I was Neapolitan and went great with the beer.  Odd combination but it worked.  We were there for awhile mingling b/c there were so many foreigners there.  We finally made it to Gypsy Rock where more drinking was had and I ran into John and Brad.  I like these dudes but haven't seen them in forever since their number changed and I can't ever get in touch with them.  We closed that place down and moved to Bubble Bar.  It was there that I realized I was pretty much done for and had to bail.  That is an overview of the night.   I would like to publicly thank all those who gave me presents.  Caleb thank you for the shirt.  You will see it in action tonight.  Hopefully it will bring me some good luck.  Gabe and K-Lo thank you for the wine and calculator.  Asma, I always like Absolute and I'll have a blast with it.  And Andrea thank you so much for the gift certificate.  It will be put to good use.  I'd also like to say thanks again to everyone who came out and just made it a fun evening.  I fee like I've won an award and this is like my acceptance speech or something.   I'm not sure if anything really crazy happened.  Nothing particular comes to mind.  I slept fairly well and I'm feeling pretty good so I think I'll be able to go hard again tonight.  This morning, well afternoon when I woke up I wasn't so sure.  Today is K-Lo's birthday party celebration.  Dinner at Bennagin's should be fun.  After that, who knows.   I don't feel much older.  I think this is b/c I've been calling myself 25 for the past year do to the screwy method of assessing one's age they seem to have in Korea.   I've had to work with Judy the past two days and I've come to the conclusion that she is just a negative person.  She is always complaining and then she doesn't approach people very diplomatically when trying to resolve a problem.  She just seems lazy.   In embarrassing news when I woke up around 10ish to go to the bathroom (I wasn't completely sober at this point) I opened the door on my roommate who was taking a  shower.  Don't worry I didn't see anything and I don't think it was that awkward.  I had my earplugs in and couldn't hear the water running.  But I still think he should have locked the door.   Sarah said she has started reading my blog and that she found it refreshing as just started to read it.  That makes me a little bit happy I guess.   I feel like there was something else I wanted to talk about but I guess not, or at least I can't remember."

"urlLink Drowning in information, starved for knowledge: information literacy, not technology, is the issue  This is by Alan Bundy of the University of South Australia.  It was presented at Books and Bytes: technologies for the hybrid library 10th VALA Conference, Melbourne 16-18 February 2000.  From the abstract:  The main issue of the so called information age is still being given scant systematic attention. Even if they recognise their need for information, people often lack the understandings and skills to identify, locate, access, evaluate and then apply the needed information. Librarianship is the only profession which is really alert to this issue but has itself allowed a preoccupation with technology to obscure its response to human need , as well as to its primary responsibility for the record of civilisation. All librarians in the 21st century will need to promote the fact that it is good libraries and information literacy, not just information technology, which largely determine who are the information rich and information poor. They will also need to reintermediate through balanced use of analog and digital resources; challenge those who peddle technology as the panacea for the world's educational, economic and societal needs; assert their values and insights; and review constantly how technology in libraries is affecting their users, and the paper records of civilisation, most of which will never be digitised and with which libraries will remain entrusted."

I'm hopeless.  As for the other issue, I'm royally fucked. I'm abandoning acting, which leaves me with interests in Religion and Japanese, but definately not a combination of the two.   That first paragraph is still pretty damn true."

Such differences in the genres, but Im ignorant like that.  Ill go online later and see what I can use to distinguish them.  Its kinda like country, in that the genres are in transition and while I can say for sure with older material whats what, all the new stuff has a bit of the popular, this will sell feel to them.    Its snowing. Snowing somewhere around us. We just have rain and cold. Some snow last night, maybe some more tonight, but you can feel it, fell when theres too much hype and when well actually see something. People around us have snow, just not here in town.  I managed to complete three loads of laundry last night, as well as clean half the apartment. Im heading home to finish the job, including a proper scrubbing of the kitchen and bathroom, before I work the show tonight.    Yes, shows are back!  Please come on a Thursday night, since no one seems to bother besides a few hardy souls. And guess what yo - the other shows sell out. Think about it, packed in there, or worse, arriving late and not getting in at all, or waltzing in, putting your money down, and a nice intimate evening? Bring more folk and lets start selling Thursdays out too.  (Links to the left)  Four days of improv a week now, shows three nights, class another, and were working on a couple of more classes before our showcase on the 17th.  My brains overly saturated at this point, but I keep on chugging along. Last week was fun actually, once I ignored the pain in my head.  All I can say is we are sick fucks.

Then, during spanish Aaron (this is for you Mandy) came in to do a project with Eric and Marc and since eric sits next to me Aaron pulled up a chair and sat right next so me. And he was like \"Its SOO cold in here\" So I pulled out my hot tea and it was steaming in my face, it felt nice. Spanish is always so cold- i come prepared.  So he was like drooling over my warmness. Then, he goes \"Laaauuurrraaa, I can I wear your mittens?\" an di was like \"Um...okayy.\" So he was like, I was just joking!!

"I spent a day in San Francisco today, with the one and only lovely Madalyn. We walked along Market, and went into Sephora (where else?), as well as miss sixty (European skank shop), and Rite Aid. By that time, my tummy was a-rumblin', so we took the bus to Ocean Beach for some lunch.    Embarassing moment of the day: On the way to the beach, my bladder decided to fill up, and I had the most irresistable urge to pee. My cross country bladder took over, so we walked for ten minutes, looking for a bathroom, but there wasn't any to be found! Finally, she tells me to just pee in the tall brush that's surrounding the sidewalk-- it's in the middle of the sand and cement, so in an act of desperation, I go. Unfortunately, I'm not trained to pee in a straight line, and she kept making me laugh while squatting, so a leeetle bit was sent off into the grass. I hope it doens't die a painful death.   So we snacked on the dead crabs and rotting jellyfish strewn across the shore (actually, I brought mi sanwich de lechuga and garbanzo beans, and she had Triscuits), and walked around a bit. Then, after we had had enough sea spray, we got back on the bus and walked to the MoMA.   Excellent stuff at the MoMA SF. If you're planning on going, go now before the exhibits change. Unfortunately we didn't have that much time, because I had to hurry back for a piano lesson, but the most memorable: Sculpture of giant spiders. The largest was one and a half my height, and there were four or five slightly smaller ones clustered under its belly. Large forest room. The art was the walls, but there were some abstract and seemingly random things placed strategically around the room. Diego Rivera painting. The title had something about symbolism in it. Loved it. Black painting. A huge canvas with tarred-up newspaper thrown on, and glossed over with black. A little weird close up, but very effective. A huge pencil/charcoal drawing with so many different things in it. One of my favorites, too bad I don't remember the artist. A toilet. Put on display not because it was scuplted, but because it was \"chosen\" by a famous artist. Ha. Woman with fruits (or fruit hats or something like that). Matisse. The one you've seen everywhere. Okay, if you want more, pick my memory, but I suggest you go see it yourself. See them yourself. All of them. So after that, we ran to the BART station and back home, I fell asleep the whole way back, and then I went to my okay piano lesson. Wheeee."

"Jamie, the reason I rarely jump in the middle of these debates is because by the time I get around to reading it all, it becomes so muttled that I can't figure out what the origional point made was. Plus, all 3 of you guys are alot more politically and biblicaly intelligent than I am. I would most likely end up making points that have already been said in much higher vocabulary and just sound redundant.  But my opinion on \"the shocking lesbian kiss\", was it really that shocking? The way our media portrays sex these days, you're almost concidered not normal if you're a completly straight female. Either that, or you're just lying and denying if you claim to be completly heterosexual. But what can we do about it? Pray...seriously that's the only thing we really can do about it.....AND the whole foundation of homosexual acts is a spiritual thing, so praying would actually be more affective than protesting (yes I know that sounds completly hypocritical coming from the activist) But if we protest more against it, claiming it's vile and shouldn't be public like that, the church is just gonna be looked at as even more of a \"hater\". Cause as Jeff said, how can we expect non-christians to act christian?"

"END OF A DYNASTY   -   (The Kennedy Story)   Ching, the movie game was fun in the beginning,  but then it gets old -especially if we start using movie titles that we have nott even seen.    Why don't we agree to start our blogs with current events.  Things we may have heard in the news that day  or that week.  It can be politics,  crimes, sports, fashion, etc.  This way we can continue to share interests.  Like I would be blogging about the Williams sisters finally losing in the Indian Wells tournament.  Well it was always that they were dominating the majors. Like  was always that 2 of them battling it out in the finals.  In the semi finals this year  Venus W had  retire because of a leg injury, he sustained while battling Monica Seles,  so Kim Clisters of Australia won.  Kim has been playing so well tho (girlfriend of current no 1  Hewitt also of Australia).  And Kim finally beat Serena W in the finals, I did not get to watch the game, I was busy running around but I just check the results in the internet.  But when great people play espcially on a one to one situation, I can't miss the ummmmp..... and ahhhhhhhhh as they battle how to close out a point. Can you imagine, they anticipate, run, hit all in one rush of a moment.  Mind you though, you don't have to be interested in ones current events. It would just be a gist in the beginning  and then you can proceed with personal stuff.    I wonder what golf would be like, when I watch it in TV  it makes me fall asleep (not bad).  I heard the Lakers have been losing more now than winning  (Shaq is out for a while because of a foot injury ).  No I don't play any of those games. If I do what's the point of watching other people play.  My game is bowling - I go out every Monday to bowl and be with my friends."

Over the weekend, Jennie collected a bunch of clothes - mostly mine - to donate to  urlLink Goodwill .  So today, we had to drop off the clothes to make room in our 1997 Honda Civic sedan.  I was going to take them to the main Goodwill office here in Dayton, but then, I remembered another location.  So Keisha and I went to this other location and dropped off the clothes, which I'll say, were worth a bucketload of money for next year's income tax return (\"bucketload\" is an inexact measurement, dontcha think?).  Then, we drove across the street to the  urlLink Professional Bartending Institute , where I had my mixology classes.  I showed Keisha the bar area, which is stocked with all the bottles, containing water, food coloring, and other non-alcoholic stuff.  I think Keisha was more impressed with the \"Necessary Room,\" the name the school calls the unisex restroom for men and women.  \"The toilet water's blue!\" she chuckled. \"And it's all just my size!\"  So that was her first time in a bar."

"content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">                             &nbsp;                       Hey Glee, sounds like a         nice service. We had one yesterday in Detroit (downtown's         about 55 miles from my house). Here's the writeup I did         for one of my church music lists:           It wasn't Yankee Stadium, and Pavarotti wasn't there, but it was a glorious worship experience nonetheless.  My soul was well-fed and nurtured.  About a thousand of us jammed into Fort Street Presbyterian Church in downtown Detroit at 4pm on Sunday to pray for peace, justice, and reconciliation.  Catholics, Jews, Baptists, Muslims, Lutherans, Sikhs, Methodists, Hindus, Presbyterians, Baha'i, Orthodox, and more, all praying for the healing of our nation.  Music was provided by the 100+ voice Spiritual Day Tricentennial choir (this year is the 300th anniversary of the founding of Detroit), a number of cantors (or other faiths' versions of cantors), and a very active assembly.  15 - 20 different folks led us in prayer, and provided reflections, including Cardinal Maida, who gave the statement of purpose.  The high points: ALL the music!  (list below) Baptist Rev. Edward Branch's reflection about where God calls us; Presbyterian Rev. Arlene Wallace Gordon's prayer, based on Ps. 24; Imam Abdul Hakim Jackson's reflection about Abraham, our common ancestor in faith (best snippet for the day - &quot;always act in faith and obedience, let God provide the results&quot;); Prayer litany led by 3 middle school kids - one Muslim girl, one Jewish boy, one Christian girl the common thread through ALL the prayers and reflections - the shared faith and purpose that unite us.  Here's what I know of the song list:  Prelude:  Spiritual Day Tricentennial Choir (I only caught the tail end, and did not recognize the songs, but participated where I could, when invited) Opening: America the Beautiful, assembly and choir Hymn: O God, Our Help (St. Anne, new verses by Carolyn Gillette - I'll put them below with copyright info), assembly and choir Musical Interlude:  Battle Hymn (cool arrangement for B-3 and drums), choir ..........................:  Total Praise (Smallwood), choir (those of us who know (and LOVE) this joined in) Chanted prayer by Jeremy Campion of the Muslim Unity Center Chanted prayer by (n?) from the Hindu temple Closing: T'filat Haderich (Traveler's Prayer), cantor Stephen Dubov of Temple Beth El and assembly - lyrics below   O God Our Help, extra verses: ----------------------------------------------- O God, our words cannot express the pain we feel this day; Enreged, uncertain, we confess our need to bow and pray.  We grieve for all who lost their lives and for each infured one; We pray for children, husbands, wives whose grief has just begun.  O Lord, we're called to offer prayer for all our leaders, too; May they, amid such great despair be wise in all they do.  We trust your mercy and your grace; In you we will not fear! May peace and justice now embrace!  Be with your people here!  copyright  2001, Carolyn Winfrey Gillette, 305 S. Broadway, Pitman NJ 08071.  All rights reserved.    T'filat Haderich (Traveler's Prayer) ----------------------------------------------- May we be blessed as we go on our way. May we be guided in peace. May we be blessed with health and joy.   May this be our blessing.  Amen.  May we be sheltered by the wings of peace. May we be kept in safety and love. May grace and compassion find their way to every soul. May this be our blessing.  Amen.  (no copyright info given)  Jay"

"I finished lesson two of my small business course a couple of days ago, and I'm going to start on lesson 3 later.  The third chapter is about ethics.  Ugh.  I spent several hours yesterday looking over the different accounts and interest rates offered by the various banks in town, trying to find a better interest rate.  My current, regular savings account only earns a 1.01% interest rate.  I barely earned $29 last year, on an account that was around $3000 the whole year.  After spending several hours looking, I found a really nice account at a different bank.  It's an interest earning checking account, that earns a much higher interest rate than their normal interest-earning accounts if you have more than $2,500 in the account, which I will.  There's also no monthly charge as long as your balance remains over $2,500.  It didn't say in the brochure what the interest rate was exactly, but the way it sounds, it's probably higher than my current savings account.  So Tuesday, when I'm off I'm going to spend most of my day switching out my accounts.  First I'm going to go to the new bank, and ask them more about the account, what the interest rate is and stuff, and then, if I still want to switch, I'll have to go to my current bank and close out my accounts, and then go back to the other bank, and open my new account.  Since I'll be putting all the money from both my savings and my checking account in this new account, I'll have almost $4,000 in it.  By the end of the month I WILL have $4,000 or so.  Not back considering just a couple of weeks ago I only had around $2,800.  I'm making good progress on my goal of saving up to at least $10,000 in the next couple of years to get ready for attempting to open my own business."

It's more then a river y'a'll . And two? people go see Kill Bill. Terentino has done it again, i'm afraid to say. This movie is all my girl hood fantasies........i won't say anymore except go see it. Anyone who wants to  talk about just how straight up AWESOME this movie is, comment on my guestbook. Anyway while i'm at home and i finally have this god awful house to myself...maybe i can get some  much needed work done......maybe some writing....maybe i'll get the balls to make a fone call that i need to make.....romance and intimacy are not my strong suits...."
"I will say for \"Mulholland Drive,\" I felt I understood Lynch's fascination with red curtains truly for the first time. Those heavy velvet drapes used to be standard issue on every auditorium stage in like, every school in America. Did anybody get through grade school without the experience of waiting behind those curtains at least once for some performance to begin? It's probably the first time most people have a really focused awareness of there being two worlds, one \"out there\" in anticipation of which one is breathless with fear and/or excitement, and one \"in here\" which is hidden and safe at least for the time being. I now think the red curtain motif is a direct visual referent for that precise moment not just of perception but of actual experience of two different, simultaneous realities.   Just yesterday, I was groovin' on my \"March Hare.\" It's a small white plastic rabbit bobble-head with evil orange eyes. It was my birthday present from Barbara Herd this year. It is just the coolest thing that ever was. I have it stuck on the dashboard of my tiny white Metro, and it bobs along to whatever music I have on without ever missing a beat. People stare at it at intersections and cross themselves. I keep my pitch-dark glasses on and just snap my fingers off-tempo. What's really weird is that it came in the mail about a day after I saw \"Donnie Darko,\" went to the \"Donnie Darko\" website and took the \"Find out which Donnie Darko character you most resemble\" quiz and the answer came back, \"You're FRANK! Have a nice day!\""

Basically this post is about my realization of selling myself to the highest bidder and hoping that I can enjoy my job at some point.  Oh yes I almost forgot.

"Busy. Busy 1.5 day weekend...Formal, a second dog, and watched my first football game (hey, I may not have been there but I had the best seat in the house with the new 60 inch widescreen tv that FINALLY arrived)...also skipped out on work and forgot about Ruach.  I'll elaborate more tommorrow...after all what is APES for?"
"i've been feeling like shit lately, though i shouldn't, and i know i shouldn't. but i keep remembering one of jon stewart's comments during commencement at william and mary this year: \"but what i lacked in looks i made up for with a repugnant personality.\" lately it seems only 40-year-old gay men find my incessant sardonicism amusing. i think i should resolve to be less of a bitch. or at least that's what a friend tells me.   last night one of my coworkers was a bit like superman. this morning he showed up as a mild-mannered, glasses-wearing, and slightly dressed-up educational sales rep awaiting a major publishing client from boston. last night in chi-town, however, he donned his ripped and sleeveless black t-shirt, black eyeliner, and guitar in all his manifest glam rock glory and rocked the stage with three other equally glam, made-up, and frenetically manic companions who stalked about the stage, wandered into the crowd to accost female audience members, glinted light from multiple piercings, headbanged with heads of hair that haven't seen scissors since this kind of music was last seen in the 80s, and left the stage after five songs. it was great, though. all us coworkers turned up to represent. my 40-year-old gay colleague, who was drunk off of three martinis that he didn't realized would total $30 and who wiped the sweat from his forehead on my metro map to combat the lack of air circulation in the venue, kept turning to me and dropping his jaw in a dry scream as people around us more genuinely shouted out metal battle cries. after one song, \"american thunder,\" sent the band into frenetic convulsions while screaming the title over and over, he turned to me and asked - are they saying a man came to fuck me? hey, i wasn't surprised either. but you should hear the things that come out of my mouth."

"Different...But Not, Really    Over the past month or so, I've had quite a few encounters with people who...are not mentally the same as me.  Some people would say they're sick.  But they're not sick. They're just different, and there's nothing wrong with that at all. Hell, we're all different.  The people I have run into were all so friendly and outgoing. They just started talking to complete strangers like myself. I think this admirable, really. I smiled and talked with them. I didn't treat them with any less respect than I would show anyone else. I don't know why anyone would.  Some people do, though. And it actually hurts me to see it."

"It's almost eleven on Friday the ninth, and I'm already bored! One of those things where you spend all your time doing nothing and then wonder where the time went. Anyway I thought I'd just share some of my random thoughts on Good Friday with y'all.  Why is it called 'Good Friday'? Other than refering to the fact that we have no school.... I would almost tend to think of it as being 'bad Friday' because today is when we recognize Jesus' death on the cross. Good? not when you first think about it but-yes! Because if today had never happened and I was sitting in Chemistry class like I would be on a normal Friday at this time, I would be doomed to live forever away from God! The thought seems almost unreal. I sit here with all my comforts taking God's grace for granted. I am so selfish! I don't even begin to deserve all that I have! And God even grants my smallest wishes! (For example I really wanted to be in the school play. I prayed to God, and I have a fairly large part!). And when sometimes it is not his will to grant my desires, I get upset!!! God wants the best for my life and I have absolutely NO reason to get upset when things don't go my way! OK so thanx for staying there with me. I hope that Passion Play goes well! Good luck, and sing well all my sophomore choir friends!"
"I saw you standing in the corner On the edge of a burning light I saw you standing in the corner Come to me again, in the cold, cold night You make me feel a little older, Like a full grown woman might But when you're gone I grow colder, Come to me again in the cold, cold night I see you walking by my front door I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor I don't care what other people say I'm going to love you, anyway Come to me again in the cold, cold night I can't stand it any longer I need the fuel to make my fire bright So don't fight it any longer Come to me again, in the cold, cold night And I know that you feel it too, When my skin turns into glue, You will know that its warm inside And you'll come run to me, In the cold, cold, night"
"The human emotion is a wretched wretched thing sometimes. The way the world can suddenly tear out the happiness and joy you were just in rapture with and twist and contort it into a completely opposite feeling is so destructive. An enlightenment, be it something really unpleasant to discover, hit me the other day. Its left me little to dwell on than itself. I find myself in a state of meloncholy and depression, as i long for something that i cant seem to grasp, despite the fact that many others  that i know can. Something that eludes me, taunts me, and kills me a little inside, every day. Maybe tomorrow will be different, but i cant see how. Maybe something will come to light, things will change, and all will be good in the world once more. The space that my friends fill is as big as ever, but the hole that they cant is growing. I need that sort of nourishment to be happy, and right now, i havent even had a taste of what i desire. Maybe tomorrow will be different. I sure as hell hope so. If not, things wont change, obviously. Maybe i can learn to cope, which is most likely, but maybe, ill keep dwelling on it. Hopefully not, but either way, its something that i have to do, myself. Nobody can really help, if i aksed, or if they wanted to. It doesnt work like that. I really dont know how it works, or even if anybody could understand this if they tried. Life is good. Friends are good. School is going as well as to be expected. But something still is missing. I wish i knew how to fill the void. Others can, so why cant i. Im only 16, i have the rest of my life, yea yea. But other 16 year olds, and then others that are younger are having no trouble it seems. I dont know, im rambling again. I just wish i didnt need to. This stupid journal has seemed to be somebody i can talk to. Somebody who wont judge me, or mock me. Somebody i dont have to worry about thinking differently of me, or pitying me, or laughing at me behind my back. If i only i could find somebody like this to help me fill the space. If only. Maybe tomorrow will be different.  Oh yea, and hey, if you're reading this, maybe people will like you more, or not talk bad about you behind your back, or act two faced towards you if you dont take people's pretzels, or stare at people because they're having a good time, or ask people to be quieter for no reason. Its just a suggestion. I guess i would be corrupted too if i dated somebody who looked like they just got back from a photo shoot for a gushers commercial.  No quotes worth putting.

My friend and I have a theory that east coasters say ON and west coasters say IN....but HER friend from Jersey says IN.  So it may just be NYers.  what do you guys say? and do you know any east coasters that could help in my lil \"experiment\"?  personally, i think \"on\" line is retarded but whatever.  Oh, evidence for the east/NY theory is that on FRIENDS ross says \"on\" line....altho the show is taped in LA, but the writers i'm assuming are NYers??  *shrug* just something random that bothers me hehe...weird NYers. :P  time to sleeeeep."
"Kiss and Make Out  I am making out with XX again, but only because I like to kiss. We hang out sometimes but more not than often. He is more tolerable and charming this way and I am my best self. I still find him handsome and sexy but I no longer inquire or care about his feelings towards me and I'm no longer annoyed nor elated by him. I'm redistributing my eggs and I'm deciding whether his one egg will be poached or rotten. I have more though. Here are the baskets that each carry one or more eggs:   Playing music  at Lennon Studios with SJ and J-Wo. The familiar ache and hardening of my fingertips is a great feeling.   Fiddling around in the kitchen.  Yesterday while Green Marble and Scooter ran laps and laps around a track and I watched them from the bleachers, I had a revelation: White Sauce Lasagna. Like an Alfredo Lasagna. I am thinking chicken and ricotta and roasted garlic and sun-dried tomatoes and chestnuts. I told GM & S my great idea and they, being gourmands, said white sauce lasagna has been done and were skeptical of the chestnut idea. They will see. I'm not a genius when it comes to making up recipes, but I am very creative and have great ideas. Though my risk-taking is hit-or-miss. Once when I was a very little kid, I wanted to \"be punished\" like how kids are on family TV so I announced that I would make dinner for everyone. No one knew what I was talking about cuz I was a little kid and how could I possibly make dinner. My aunt was preparing food in the kitchen so I took a big cup and filled it with scoops of rice, thit kho (salted pork), and vegetables. Then I poured orange juice to the top. When my parents and my brother came home, I said look! I made dinner, then demonstrated how to consume it by taking in mouthfuls of meat, rice, and OJ simultaneously. I thought it was delicious. My brother begged for an alternative. My parents laughed. My family sat down to their conventional dinner while I continued gulping down OJ and pork.   The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie. This is the novel of novels in my book, er, world. The notoriety, the dense prose, the volume. I am completely intimidated by its formidable reputation. Thus I've convinced LingL and XX to read it with me. They rip through books, so I have a healthy dose of competition to keep my mind on the text at hand. We've formed a book club and it's called \" The Kool Kids Book Klub .\" There are no perks or rewards but there ARE membership cards which I crafted yesterday. I've made slots for six books to be read together by Kool Kids. Any joiners? The only thing you have to do to join is start reading The Satanic Verses and try to finish it within a reasonable amount of time. Oh, and you have to be kool.   I'm also trying to  exercise  more, but I'm not sporty or outdoorsy at all. When I tagged along with Green Marble and Scooter to the Kezar track, they ran at least 7 laps, and me? I pooped out after 3/4 of one. 3/4 of a lap and totally winded. Plus, I only have my sleepytime sweatpants that lost its drawstring years ago. My pants couldn't stay up! I had to choose between exercise and modesty. It wasn't my total surrender to fatassy-ness and sloth that made me take a seat and dream up white lasagna. It's because I'm a modest Christian. Butt cleavage is the devil's tools, doncha know."
"Since the movie independence Day came out, way back in the days of my youth, it has bothered me. In fact, almost to the point of rage. I would have probably forgotten it, in time, but the fire has been stoked. Of course they would play the movie today, and of course Scott would watch it. My issue: How does the dorky guy upload a computer virus to some alien computer with his Apple laptop? It isn't even an IMac.  Seriously, I know we're talking about an alien movie, but a little credibility please. The worst part is he does it through his dial up internet connection... What the hell. If the aliens ever do come maybe I should make sure I have a Palm Pilot so I can beam them a copy of Dope Wars to entertain them and possibly convince them to spare our puny little asses. Yeah, that'll work great. Anyhow, it makes me feel good to finally publicly express that issue which has bothered me for the past 10 years. Maybe now I can sleep a little easier."

"Out of 100............    ......... I would have raped 99!!! Guys, yesterday was the opening of a new flagship store on 5th avenue called \" Mexx \". Of course, with all the NYC fashion hoopla, balloons, camera's, Stereo systems, model's, and a cheap gimmick were all introduced at a vain attempt to have people walk into this store. For the record, the marketing behind it was genius considering that it pandered to every schmuck with a low -self esteem. As I walked passed the store, a rather annoyingly voiced lady was shouting, \" Be our next model, have your face across Times Square, Pick a number and live your dream \". I would compare her voice between a cross of Steve Urkel from the now dyfucnt show of \" Family matters\"  and Rosie Perez multiplied several times over. As I walked slowly to take in this debacle. I noticed the incredible array of \" beautiful people \". I use that word \" Beautiful \" very loosely and as sarcastically as possible. Models upon Models in a span of one block.  Scantly clad women hoping that the exposure of clevage would give them a shot at \" Bill Board \" stardom. Uh, the guys were buffed, tall, with the bestly primped eyebrows I have ever seen. Walking down this block was like a bad episode of \" Blind date \". There had to be more hair gel and make-up on that one block then all of NYC put together. Here is the kicker, out of the 100 guys that I saw hoping to have their face plastered on a billboard, I would have fucked 99 of them. I have no qualms completely and unabatedly sexually violating one of these model dudes. I know my Lenny is gorgeous but some of these guys look rather scrumtious.  It's just not right to see these dudes, buffed, good looking, and making this Derek Zoolander type of living.    It is not right.  So if you are a good looking model guy, you better hope I never get arrested with you.   Peace, Love, Porkchops."

"I have decided to post the short story that I wrote on the airplane coming back from Orlando.  The main character represents Stephanie, and the other character (other than the pilot) represents myself.  The implication that she likes me has been fictionalized.  All else is true.     Going Back  by Alexander Dietz    	We are beginning our descent.?  	The pilot spoke as they all do, mechanically, matter-of-factly; you knew how he was going to say it quite accurately before the thing was said.  Even so, it touched her more deeply than if she had been hit by a baseball.  For now, she was coming home.  For now, she was going back.  	The trip had only lasted a few days, but it had taken her away from herself.  This is not to say that it was exciting or fantastic on any objective level, but it did let her catch a few breaths and look at things as what they were.  She did not know whether she liked it like that.  Although the holiday was a welcome one, she missed her family, her friends, and her quotidian life.  	She brushed back her long, silken hair before returning her tray table to its full upright and locked position.  She was very pretty  you wouldnt say hot? or fine? like you would for those big-breasted, big-butted girls who flaunt themselves, but she still had quite a body, and when you caught a glimpse of her face, it was hard to look away.  The curves of her cheeks, the slope of her chin, and oh, those eyes; those eyes always knew how to get your attention.  	They were at twenty thousand feet.  	She thought of her world, the world to which she was coming back, the world where she had learned to become who she was.  He was there; she was quite aware of this, but she did not know how she should deal with it, what she should do, whether she should act at all.  	They had known each other for some time now.  She knew, she thought she knew, how he felt about her.  She had decided that she didnt like him  yes, she liked him, but she didnt like him.  Of course not.  He was foolish, he wasnt the best-looking guy, he thought too much of himself, he had made some choices that she knew were immoral, and he didnt even seem to regret them.  She wasnt sure if he even respected her, given some of the things he had said.  That wasnt the reason they werent together, mind you.  She just didnt like him.  Not like that.  	But there was something there.  She couldnt put a name on it, and it didnt mean anything.  Did it?  They understood each other, and they had something, but it was probably just something platonic.  He still loved her, though.  There were other girls, and things change, but he still loved her.  On the other hand, there were definitely other guys.  	Should they just keep things the way they are?  It was working out, for what it was worth, and if anything happened, it would probably end worse than if nothing happened.  They had been down that road before.  Most likely, it would take them to the same place.  Wouldnt it?  	We have arrived at the international airport.  Local time is 1:03 pm.  We hope you enjoyed your flight, and thank you for choosing us.?  	She looked out the window.  It was raining, but it didnt matter."

"Hey gals! I'm finally getting around to posting this weekend- this is actually the first time I've turned on the computer this weekend.  I went through and boxed up some books for storage and reorganized some stuff.  I feel like I only got 1/4 of the way done; I have so much left to do but I got 4 boxes of books (these are like paper boxes) and two boxes of latch hook and other needlework crafts that I will work on later.  He's lucky enough to get the day off tomorrow (Columbus Day) so he's going to take them over to the storage unit tomorrow.  I watched 2 out of 3 of my tapes from the week; Rick & Shep were so funny on Studio B on Friday! The Cubs lost today :-(  Better luck Tuesday, I guess.  It's official:  I'm super sick & tired of hearing about the Kobe case.     Teri-  Actually you could only see the upper pocket area of Rick's jeans- not a full shot.  They've had other segments though where he's wearing jeans though.....I'm tellin' ya, satellite's the way to go! ;-)     Jayel-  You're welcome for the Rick alert! ;-)  It looks like he made a few appearances that day- now watch it'll probably be another week before we see him again.  LOL, I saw that billboard segment on Fox & Friends- that was just too funny.  I hope Rush is able to break his dependency too.  Like my hubby said, the libs will probably make a big deal out of it just because he's a conservative.  Like *they've* never had people with dependencies....it's really a shame that they just can't leave him alone.  Now that you mention it, I was wondering about the whole \"boss\" comment too.  When I heard it, I thought he was just joking around, maybe some inside joke between them.  That was such a good segment- had to rewind and rewatch a couple of times.  I agree with what you said about Jeff Goldblatt.  Maybe they'll give more to him to cover as well.     Nan-  I *love* having cereal for dinner- even if my hubby thinks I'm crazy for it.  I think I ate half a box of Lucky Charms once as a sort of 'comfort food'.  My all time favorite comfort cereal though is cream of wheat with brown sugar.  I'd love to have the Cubs & the Red Sox in there, but I'm not sure how likely that is.  Wow, sounds like Amber & I were there at SFSU about the same time- I started in Spring 1996, but didn't change my major to English/Creative Writing until Fall 1997.  She probably has Pete Wilson's stamped signature on her diploma; I'm pretty sure Davis came to office in 1998.  That's cool that your son will have Ahnold's on his! ;-)  I agree- Rush will be in our prayers too.     Sherry- Congrats on sticking to your diet & Curves! :-)  LOL- girl, you read my mind on that jeans camera shot....I was like, \"keep going! what's wrong with you?!? Keep going!!\" LOL!  I kept rewinding to see if I missed something....I didn't but the camera man did, LOL!  Good luck on the midterms- I'm sure you'll do great!  OMG- Greg's in the Nov. Cosmo??  I haven't rec'd my issue in the mail yet- should be anytime soon.  I just went through October's I think....when I saw your post I had a slightly anxious thought that I went through November's and completely missed it.  **whew** Glad that wasn't the case.  That's so cool that he got picked!  Good for you that you didn't eat anything!  If I remember correctly, lite beer is less points than red wine.  Unfortunately I just don't like beer- I've tried it time and again, but it doesn't take.  You *should* feel good about being 'good' at the party!  That's willpower!    Jan-  The \"Girls Weekend\" sounded fun- that's a great idea and tradition.  Glad you had a great time! I think most of my blood related family members are girls too, now that I think about it.  The pocket thing was on Fox Report on Thursday- he was talking about the \"curse of the Bambino\" & reached into his pocket for 27 cents to put on Babe's grave.  I'm pulling for the Cubbies too- I take it you saw that game yesterday (Saturday)?  Wow, what a game.  I was so disappointed with how they did today, but will keep my fingers crossed for Tuesday.  You know, I was thinking the other day how approachable Rick has been, and as you said \"so eager to please us LevenGals\"- that's so true! Sometimes I think he's surprised that he has fans, LOL.     Leslie-  I survived, but wow.....Friday was great (even if I just saw the coverage today).  Where *is* Melissa???  I hope things get better with Roy's job; that's scary when it gets to that point.  I always find that somehow we land on our feet too.  Hang in there, we're all thinking & praying for you.  That was so funny when Shep was talking about what Red Sox fans would be miserable about for the rest of their lives if they won.  I'm pulling for them though- even though our Fox guys are rooting for the Yankees.  Dry cereal could be good to snack on.....but it's not the same without milk."
"I'd think about coming up on the 12th if I had someone to drive with.  Who knows what's going to be going on that weekend, anyway?  I know that the first weekend in July we're having Maggie's 1st birthday party at my parents' house.  Other than that, my schedule is clear.  Sounds like a good time, though. :)  Let me know what's going on.  I'd love to see Bob's fam again...;)    Well, no news on this end.  Big surprise there, I know. :)  Anyway, I'm going back to my desk to enjoy the sunshine.  Have a good afternoon!  KJT:)"
"There I was, flitting around on the web looking for myself, when I realized that I've been  urlLink added  to BlogsCanada (see link, to the right). Not only that, but I've got a little thumbs-up sign next to my name, which means that you're making a worthwhile investment in, well, not paying to see my site.  And then I realized that I'm completely marooned on this site - writing, for all I know, solely for my own sense of fun and adventure. Not only did I lose my SiteMeter in the Big Crash, but I also lost the mailto: function - and so I re-established it. So now you can write to me if you feel so inclined; and please do, because it would be nice to hear more than my own echo around here."
"I went with the lucky tie.  It worked....all charges were dismissed and I didnt even have to pay the ticket for running the red light.  It feels wrong, but I shouldnt complain.  Today in Chicago:  My landlord and a building inspector walked in on me getting out of shower.  Buck nekid. I got my hair cut by a Tibeten girl whose entire immediate family was massacred in Nepal. I saw a black woman walking down the street dressed as the Statue of Liberty. The ass ripped out of my favorite pair of jeans and exposed my boxers with the pigs on them.  It is times such as these that I have an extreme urge to drop out of society and go surf in Goa."
"Well the graduation gig is done and that is the end of orchestra for the year. whew.. It was also the final time I got to see the seniors, some I am proud to call my friends, some I wish I got to know better, and some I never met before in my life. Still it's sad that they are gone.The gig overall went well. Suprisingly some people were listening as we played Pirates of the Caribean in prelude. 7-8 run throughs of Pomp and Circumstance, and Aeidu. Saw some of my teachers...(including ones I have stuff due tomorrow..and of course I haven't done it yet eek!) Said goodbye to some seniors. and there goes about 6 hours of my day.  I'm tired"

"CUBS RELEASE STATEMENT ON FAN          October 16, 2003, 2:42 PM CDT  The Chicago Cubs' organization Thursday released the following statement:    \"The Chicago Cubs would like to thank our fans for their tremendous outpouring of support this year. We are very grateful.  \"We would also like to remind everyone that games are decided by what happens on the playing field -- not in the stands. It is inaccurate and unfair to suggest that an individual fan is responsible for the events that transpired in Game 6. He did what every fan who comes to the ballpark tries to do -- catch a foul ball in the stands. That's one of the things that makes baseball the special sport that it is.  \"This was an exciting season and we're looking forward to working towards an extended run of October baseball at Wrigley Field.\"    [P.S. - My second thought about this incident, after my first one which was \"how appalling!\", was that I'll bet there'll be a t.v. movie about this.  Sure enough, on the news just moments ago, \"Coming up at 10... a Hollywood film company wants to make a film about the Chicago Cubs Curse fan.\"]"

"How's everyone doing tonite? good i hope! Tonite i got into a major fight with my dad, and then had to go to work for a freaking half an hour, to finish up training on paperwork for a managers position.  I was already in a bad mood, let alone i had to put up with someone at work who would not stop talking to me about my previous boyfriends! Well then i went home and was waiting on rach to come over when my dad showed up at my mom's house!  We all got into a big fight which wasnt good!  Well then tonite, i was waiting on eric to get on the net, to talk to him b/c he is a really easy person to talk to, and i texted his phone and told him there was an emergency, joking around! well he took me seriously, and being the sweetheart he is, ran home to talk to me! Now i feel terrible that he did that!  I completely wasted his nite over a dumb joke! i am so sorry eric!  Rach come over tonite, and now we are watching mtv movies awards and being retarded doing crosswords!hehe! welp have a good nite everyone! -ash-"
"Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry sorry David you thought that was me attacking you? If you must know I was not. That was actually me pointing out that you don't need to remind people to blog, thats what I do. Yes people have exams but I'm still trying to get people to blog at least once a week so really Dave, there is no need for you too. And I am deeply deeply troubled and sorry that I asked to chill out I mean how could I possibly have taken those posts the wrong way? I mean the fact that what you both wrote seemed to me, a innocent bystander, very sarcastic and a bit bitchy was completely my fault and I shall never never do it again. Oh dear, the consequences of my words of trying to calm you down when you did seem rather annoyed. Bad Nicki for trying to sort out nedativeness on the blog. Bad Nicki. How dare you! If you like I can demonstrate me attacking you, here we go:   First of all , you can not attack  me  for asking people to calm down when there is clearlya small upset weather or not you were joking. How the fuck am I supoosed to know that? I quote: It seems to me that the only time in which you blog, is to contradict, or genrally attack what someone else has said. -  6/10/2004 10:51:28 PM. That sounds like you are being bitchy and I care what the fuck you think about that because everyone is bitchy sometimes yes like me being bitchy and fucking pissed off right now. Ooo great start to the day huh? Thanks.   Secondly , I was only telling you to fucking relax because you got all annoyed and at this time most people need to relax anyway but bad Nicki for trying to her mates to calm down and feel better. I'll never do it again.   Thirdly , You and Tom don't clash? Fine. Fair enough. I'm not actually bothered but in that case if you are joking around together make it more clear or just don't jokily insult each other that way dumbass people like me won't get confused and try to help sort it out. Gosh I still can't believe, I was simply trying to help you out. Never again.   Fourthly , shut the fuck up about my spelling no one spells perfectly all the bloody time and usually if your writing things in a rush not everything is spelt right. Ooo how dare I say that, I bet your spelling is perfect allllll the time. And anyway don't start on all that jazz until you can blog perfectly, ie: using an I instead of i.   And Finally , I am bitchy and probably always will be.  Now I didn't have a problem with you and I don't want you to leave. I was simply trying to sort your little what appeared to me to be a tiff out so that it did not escalate into pages like this and getting people all wound up for nothing. For maybe next time instead of you being so public about attacking me you should talk to me.  Have a nice day.  Back to normal blogging.  I had begun my day quite happily. Felt fufiled by my breakfast and then I came on here to check email and whatnot to find I was being attacked as people like to put it and so now my happy mood has drastically gone downhill. Great. Have a nice day everyone.  And yes I know I could've simply either said sorry or just not replied at all but hey I'm childish and was under the impression that it was my blog to start off with and that you knwo kinda said I could try and stop people from arguing. Oh how disillusioned I am."

"So I finally decided to play some online poker.   Night 1 went swimmingly.   I was playing at a $.50/$1  limit holdem table.  I made $23 in 1.5 hours.   I must admit I feel like i have turned a corner in poker.  On my last trip to foxwoods I lost.  And while that may seem like a bad thing, I actually learned a TON on that trip.    First, I have successfully memorized  urlLink Mike Caro's Laws of Tells .  No joking, while I was there, I was able to read tells all the time.  And in several instances (lets say 7) I was able to act accoriding to the tells.  5 out of the 7 times, they worked distinctly in my favor, and on 2 times I was fooled and got burned.  But no tells are ever perfect, and I truly believe I was running that table and totaly in control for several hours.  The painful lesson I did learn however, was that after a few hours, I get sloppy and tired.   And I need to learn to just get out.    Hence my online poker regiment.  A set time limit of 2 hours.  A set limit of a max and a min money amount. (if I hit either, I leave).  All of these are just ways to keep myself disciplined.  The amazing thing is, it all seems so simple to me now.  If you play tight (meanign only stay in with good hands, never bluff, never chase..etc)  You can just wait out a pot.  Last night I only saw the flop on about 34% of the hands I was dealt.  That means I folded before the flop on 66% of the hands.  I was playing nice and tight.   Oh.. and I also won 16% of all hands that I was dealt, which means I won about half of the pots I played in.  And it turns out, I left pots early when they didnt work out.   Only about 2 times did I stay to the river to lose the pot.  Very good night.  Lets see if my strategy holds up.   Tight play.  Short Time Limits.  Follow my own rules."

Rewarding a child in that posture, will produce an adult who tolerates messiness and disorder.    Happy Friday!"

"I still can't even fathom what he did to his first girlfriend."
"Both hit & run, once while I was in the car, the other I wasn't.  The first one was two years ago, outside the Eat 'n Park. After we finished eating, I walked outside the restaurant & there was a guy standing next to my car. He inquired if it was mine, I said yes, & then he informed me that someone hit it & left. He actually witness the entire thing. Kid back up a little too fast, hit the front of my car, got out, said \"dude let's leave\" & left. The witness got the license plate & called the cops. (He was also on a first date with a girl who worked at a police station, bonus points for him!!)  The second one I was waiting to make a left at a light. The street was narrow (no, not in Pittsburgh?? It's true, my friend) making it difficult for two normal size cars to drive with ease. Well, lucky me, I was next to a truck with a trailer connected to the back. The back tire didn't quite make it past my car & pushed in the front end side & left black marks. The guy stopped, I pulled over, the guy left. Argh. I called it into my insurance company, just so they were aware.  When I got my insurance bill this time around I was a little confused as to why it was 100-120 dollars more, then it hit me: that damn hit & run I reported. Next time I'm keeping my mouth shut. It wasn't even my fault & I get penalized. Nevermind I've never been pulled over, never gotten a ticket & I've never  caused  an accident. Humph!"

The weather was extraordinarily nice today - really warm and sunny, so the only sensible thing is to have a barbeque later - lovely!  Probably go over to Jo's sisters place as we haven't been there for a while.  At least it seems like the summer is starting to show it's face - what are the odds of the weather being like last year - pretty remote I should think - but I am not going to be negative, the summer has hardly had a chance to start yet!"

"An excerpt from Ebert's review of the revival of \"Eyes Without a Face\"...  *****  \"....One of the tasks faced by serious filmgoers is to distinguish good films in disreputable genres. It is insufferable to claim you \"never\" see horror movies (or Westerns, musicals, war movies, teenage romances or slasher pictures). You're presenting ignorance as taste.  The trick is to find the good ones. The French auteur critics did a lot of helpful spadework, resurrecting genres and rehabilitating reputations, but they were not always right -- and besides, you have to feel it for yourself. If a film holds my attention, it is in one way or another a good one. If it moves or delights me, it may be great. If I am distracted by its conventions, obligatory scenes and carelessness or lack of ambition, it deserves to be tossed back into the genre.\""

"man, I hate Monday mornings...I don't know why because there is no one here to bug me...I think it is just the thought that, had it still been the weekend, I would not be here...but since it is Monday morning, I am sitting at my desk procrastinating at 7am!  Well, our weekend was good...the Greek Festival on Friday and T&J on Saturday.  I forget how much I miss T until I spend time with her...she has got to be the one girl that I could guarantee I will always be friends with.  She knows me so well and she is not into the petty/catty bs other girlfriends are into...needless to say, I hated it when they had to leave.  And K is such a little gem!  She was cracking me up even though she barely said anything!  She is a strange mixture of complete girly and tomboy...it is funny to watch...Sunday we went to see grandma.  Well, I hate to say it but she drives me nutso sometimes.  I know it is terrible...I know...but she lays on these massive guilt trips.  I just want to scream, do you understand I work???  It is major frustration and add to that the fact she is losing her mind and she was telling these crazy stories about B and others about my dad.  I feel bad but I just didn't have patience for it yesterday...before everyone here slays me, I am consciously going to try to see her more often and I do love her very much...  On a more not upbeat note...I have had two very deep conversations with both of my younger sisters.  The first was on Thursday night...B and I went to my parents to drop off some baby paraphenalia for my older sis.  They were going to see her NY and I wanted to send some bigger stuff with them so I wouldn't have to ship it.  Well, L and I got talking...her opening line???  Have you ever tried ecstacy?  After I lifted my jaw off the table, I said, no...the one thing I have never tried would be drugs.  Well, this loser of a guy she is \"dating\" (mind you, she says HE told her they were dating) wants to give her some for her birthday.  Supposedly, she told him no but he is insisting.  She said she doesn't know what to do because she doesn't want him to get mad because he spent so much money on it... EXCUSE ME?!?!  So, I just busted out the, have you had sex before?  To which she said, yes...are you currently?  No...I couldn't get too much out of her...no condom, no birth control...but I couldn't get much else out, she said it really wasn't her choice that they didn't use a condom...again, what?!?!  I asked her if she was telling me she was raped...she said no...were you conscious? Yes...were you trashed?  I don't remember what she said...she said it was a one time deal and she has been beating herself up about it.  Lordy...there was so much I needed to say to this girl...considering my parents were lurking, I knew my time was limited...so I started...you need to wear a condom, not only will it protect you from pregnancy but it will also protect you from most other std's that you SURELY do not want, not excluding AIDs...drugs, I understand people do them, I understand people think they are okay...knowing MANY people who have done a variety of things, I don't buy it...God only gives you so many brain cells and why waste them...not to mention, you don't know who got what where and what they put into it...unless you are growing it yourself, it isn't 100% assured it is what you think it is...not that I am advocating growth, because that will get you locked up...as for beating yourself up, if you think you made a mistake, step back, analyze what happened and why you did it, and learn from it...life is too short to live with regrets and all we can do is live life the best way we can...  Well...obviously, she is beating herself up because of what my parents would think.  I told her, there has to come a point in your life where you look at what mom and dad taught us and accept and reject the principles to adapt your own...you cannot live your entire life for mom and dad because, no matter what, they will find something that could be better.  She completely agreed but said that it was a lot easier coming from me considering I never cared what they thought of me...I kind of laughed and said, well I don't now but I did...in high school I drove myself nuts trying to please them but I was coming behind the girl they deem \"perfect\" so, like I said, nothing was going to make them happy...when I graduated high school, I gave them the proverbial finger and went about my own business.  It wasn't until I was out on my own in Chicago that I completely made all of my decisions.  On top of that, I basically showed through my actions that if mom wanted to lay guilt trips, I would have nothing to do with her.  I think she finally got the picture that I was never going to be her idea of what I should be and gave up...to move on to the next sister, I'm sure.  I also told L that I would be lying if I said I still don't get hurt by it...I told her, it is hard to listen to everyone else's shining moments and then, here's B."
"From   The Idea of a University     by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  \"Knowledge is one thing, virtue is another; good sense is not conscience, refinement is not humility, nor is largeness and justness of view faith. Philosophy, however enlightened, however profound, gives no command over the passions, no influential motives, no vivifying principles. Liberal Education makes not the Christian, not the Catholic, but the gentleman. It is well to be a gentleman, it is well to have a cultivated intellect, a delicate taste, a candid, equitable, dispassionate mind, a noble and courteous bearing in the conduct of life;-these are the connatural qualities of a large knowledge; they are the objects of a University; I am advocating, I shall illustrate and insist upon them; but still, I repeat, they are no guarantee for sanctity or even for conscientiousness, they may attach to the man of the world, to the profligate, to the heartless,-pleasant, alas, and attractive as he shows when decked out in them. Taken by themselves, they do but seem to be what they are not; they look like virtue at a distance, but they are detected by close observers, and on the long run; and hence it is that they are popularly accused of pretence and hypocrisy, not, I repeat, from their own fault, but because their professors and their admirers persist in taking them for what they are not, and are officious in arrogating for them a praise to which they have no claim. Quarry the granite rock with razors, or moor the vessel with a thread of silk; then may you hope with such keen and delicate instruments as human knowledge and human reason to contend against those giants, the passion and the pride of man. \""

Calling All You Angels by Train reminds me of the California Pizza Company with Caitlin and Debbie and shopping at the Dove mall right before Youth Nationals 2002.  Get Low by Lil' Jon reminds me of Kaci's party last year.  Tipsy by J-Kwon reminds me of Sara spending the night.  Roses by Outkast reminds me of Haley, Goodson, Emily, Dock, Sara, Sarah, and Austin all coming over.  Hot in Herre by Nelly reminds me of driving around with Kassidy a few summers ago.  Dirrty by Christina Aguilera reminds me of 8th grade.  Rock Your Body by Justin Timberlake reminds me of being in an airplane late at night, headphones on, looking down at Albuquerque below me, and sooo excited for Youth Nationals 2003.  Anyway by O.A.R. reminds me of ND cheerleading tryouts in 2003 and riding around with Sarah all day in Cape.  Milkshake by Kelis reminds me of freshman Christmas dance, and getting my picture taken with Cort, Lindz, Claire, Emily, Goodson, and Kaci because Lindz was singing it while her mom was taking the picture.  Yeah by Usher reminds me of JP's party and Sarah smacking Dock's butt haha."
"Apparently, I'm wordy this evening....  Speaking of \"Knowing him when\" Nate sent us a copy of the script for his next movie. Abby's planning on auditioning for this one. Might as well since she's been in the last two. We'll have a whole collection of movies by Nate staring us. Then, when he's famous, we'll sell them on E-bay and make tons of money. ;)"

"Home   The holiday trip to Iowa was great -- throat-aching, snot-dripping cold notwithstanding.  We played tons of canasta, bonded with the niece and nephew, ate like fiends, and sneaked away in twos and threes to discuss Christmas gift ideas.  We even ordered  urlLink my favorite Cedar Rapids pizza  Saturday night and gorged ourselves like Rush Limbaugh in an opium den.   I also managed to make a Home Depot run with Jeff and Matt to get all the stuff I needed to move three light switches to make room for my fabulous new  urlLink wall hanging .  And when I finally lugged all my new electrical stuff, patch kits and borrowed tools home today, I called the antiques dealer to make the formal purchase ... and the hanging had sold  yesterday .  Shit shit shit shit shit.  Oh, well.  I guess that just means more shopping ..."
"You know when you have those weekends that are busy but then on Monday you have no idea what you did? I felt that way this morning, extremely foggy headed. Last week as ridiculously busy, this week so far is dead. I have a major headache right now so I don't mind the quite cube.   Some of you knew that I was doing the south beach diet for the last two weeks. What promised to be a weight loss of 8 to 13 pounds ended up being 4 pounds in two weeks, in which all of it was regained this weekend when I drank one night, and munched all day one day. Mostly water weight I'm sure, but I've been educating myself to the Nth degree on weight, calories, studies on weight loss and the like. Any questions...I know it all! Doesn't mean I can loose weight successfully ;)   I'm suppose to go run tonight with the LArunning group I belong to, but I'm not going. This headache and I are going to lay in bed and watch Ryan Seacrest until I feel better. Running later maybe...but not after work.   I've been feeling distant lately from my friends. I feel like summer has brought busy times, but strangely I'm getting really used to being alone. I don't necessarily mind it, but I'm used to it. Life is quiet right now.  I called a guy I went on a date with about 2 months ago on Saturday. The French guy who took the notepad from the Ritz. I just had this urge and feeling like I should call him, like I cut things off too soon or something. So I did. He said he was pleased that I called, we chatted, and I said call me later this week if you want to chat or get drinks. We'll see if he calls, not sure how I feel about it if he does, but whatever at least I got that urge out of my system.  I visited my friend Nichole this weekend. She was once a coworker of mine and is having a baby tomorrow! I can't believe it. I've known her since she got pregnant...it is amazing what can happen in such a short amount of time--a human is created. Wow...She's great and so lucky. Her husband is fabulous and her house is gorgeous and she has a new BMW, a rock on her finger and a healthy little girl on the way. I'm pretty sure she isn't going to be working after Stella--the baby--is born so that means possible full time job for me! We'll see. Nichole deserves the fabulous life she has...bc she is pretty freakin' great. another good role model for me. I am blessed with a lot of older really great role models-- JP, Kim, and Nichole. Maybe being 27-29 isn't so bad. ;)  Please pray for those that are struggling right now. Life isn't easy and demands persistence and perseverance.

"Yay, I actually managed to get 5 hours of sleep for once. Truly amazing!  Someone asked me this weekend, why I'm being such a bitch at times. Standard answer: Because I can!   Well, sugar.... If you deserve it, I show no mercy!   Ah, so Mad Maddox has been \"released\" from the Cuckoo's Nest once again. You would think that they'd know you by now, right sweetie? ;-p  Good to know that you're back to..... well... since I can't say 'normal' I'll just say 'your old self'. *snickers* Glad I could be of some service by entertaining you with this blog.   For those who doesn't know, Maddox, mostly known as \"The Twit\", is my former forum-master on the Crypto-zoo forum where I used to be an admin. One of the few guys who pass the \"test\" although he hasn't turned 35 just yet (one year to go, sweetie). He's a great guy with a mind even more twisted than mine, so beware. He also has the bad habit, from time to time, of asking me to marry him.  No way!!!  Why not, you ask? 1. I know you! 2. You're gay and I don't want to fight with Steve all the time! 3. I've seen you naked and it nearly made me weep because of reason #2!!!  Hmmm, must be why Steve always seems to be in a bliss....  *tries to look innocent but fails utterly*  It has come to my attention that the forum wants their 'Ruthless Reaper' back.  Well guys, I'm sorry but that's impossible. I hacked Master Maddox' account and deleted my own. Well, ok... so I didn't hack it, he gave me the password long ago so I could run things from there when he was....indisposed, but I did delete my account and since I helped close the forum to new members, it's not that easy to come back, even if I wanted to.  I'm aware that the forum has turned into something it shouldn't in our absence, but with all due respect, it's no longer my problem. I ran that forum practically alone and if I want that again, I'll start my own.  Maddox, your e-mail isn't working but I know you'll read this sooner or later.  I seem to have lost the theme article I wrote on Tunguska. Please send it to me, thank you. It's the only one missing, I have all the others."
"I think I must have the only locker in school with graffiti on it  already . I mean, we've only had them for about 2 or 3 weeks now, and I've only been using mine for about 3 of those days (total). When they gave out locker assignments, I went to my locker and put my lock on it, and then promptly forgot which locker was mine. When I finally had time to hunt down where the list was kept in the office, it was Tuesday of this week. I headed over to it to check to make sure that it was really there and that I knew my combination, and when I arrived I was welcomed by the lovely sight of \" F*ck you c*nt! Die! \" in bright blue permanent ink.  Now, considering no one else knew which locker was mine, and I couldn't think of  anyone  who would feel the need to say this to me, never mind in permanent blue ink for all the school to see, I just assumed that it was a random (and extremely rude) tagging  probably from an underclassmen. However, when I returned to my locker on Thursday, I discovered a new message below it from a red ball-point pen reading, \"Never!\"  I guess this means that two people who I don't know are having anargumentt/insult fest on my locker. Why they decided to do this on  my  locker I couldn't tell you. I also couldn't tell you who was doing it, although I sure do wish I could... Anyway, I'm not sure if I should just ignore it and hope no one gives me any funny looks while I'm transferring my books to and from my locker or if I should try to have someone remove it.  Oi."

"Who knows how much I'll update while back east, but knowing my ability to become bored quickly, it will be often. Sometimes I forget that everyone has those, what are they called, \"jobs\" so I'll have plenty of long, cold days to fill.   With paper writing! But I'll squeeze in a blog update or two as well.  Happy Holidays!"

"He.. is amazing.  Yesterday was so incredible, and he is so unbelievably irresistible.  I guess you could call it date #2.  I had planned to go for a walk with him, just in the area, by the park, but after deciding that i wanted a Betta fish,  we walked to pacific mall instead.  so we walk, and we talk.  it's awesome.  He is so sexy and we are always flirting, and i can't keep my eyes, my mind, Or my hands offa him!  Well i resisted for the time being, but i jsut couldn't stand it anymore!  His hands, so soft, his seductive lips, God what was I to do??   so tempting... so delicious...    (well i never Touched his lips :P too bad eh?)  yeah,.. so SExxxY.  and we all know what the XXX stands for;)  chloe and bryan.  sex maniacs, porn stars, whatever you want to call it, but you know it's existence.    His birthday present for me.. he had planned to kiss me.  And he said, when and where.  And i when i wanted it,  he couldn't pull through.  why?  Did he realize it wasn't right? not when he's still tied to danyelle.    I don't get it. there's no point pushing him either.  I just want him to mean it when he does something like that.  To really mean it, coming from his heart.  On that topic,  I'm wearing a wish bracelet which i put on on my birthday before i went to bed.  I know if anybody reads this,  my wish is doomed to die.  But i must let it out, because if i don't, i feel that my wish will have no hope of manifestation.  I wished that the man whom I truly love, would finally love me in return.   And I knew i couldn't waste this wish, but now that it's down in marble, I fear i might have.     But we can all understand why this is so.   Moulin Rouge, Christian, Satine,...  \"The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.\" it has started to fall apart, and the desire for it to shatter, and know that the one i love loves me in return has less strength that my desire to wait, and wait until I am ready to commit to love.  On the other hand.  Do i love Philip Loconte?  Could i possibly love him?  or.. puppy love, i suppose.  But i surely hope not.  I could do better. better looking,  smarter, more sensible, understanding, somebody who'll take care of me better.   But i am 15, could i possibly find a soulmate at my current age?  This goes back to Alan Reynolds.  How did i feel about him at that time...?  I thought i loved him yet i was only blinded until i realized he could not possibly feel the same way.  He was and is out of my league.  But such strong feelings that such a young age were naive.  I suppose i didn't comprehend them well enough to know my heart had only lied because my eyes had decieved me, thinking that he had felt more.   I know there are 18 milllion other guys out there. but i damn still miss talking to Alan.     anyway.  Love.  \"Make love, not war\" was what he said.. hehe ;)  love you phil!"
"Mickey's severed head   Have you ever had to set a mousetrap?  I'm not talking about those new-fangled glue traps where the mouse gets stuck on it and tries to gnaw off its own leg.  No.  I'm talking about the old school mousetraps.  The mousetraps that look like medieval torture devices.    They're scary as hell.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a complete and total stud in all aspects of manlihood.  But, oh my God if I didn't almost pee my pants trying to set that thing.  And I had to do two of them!  It's scary because the stupid thing is more sensitive than a fat girl at a dance.  I don't even know if that analogy made sense, I just wanted to say 'fat girl at a dance'.  Anyway, now I know where the expression comes from about building a better mouse trap because there's no way in my life I'm setting another mouse trap.  I'll buy some nightvision goggles and a beebee gun to hunt them down instead of setting another mouse trap.  I also think I was afraid of it because the traps that I got looked all rusted and tuberculosis-inducing.  They were in a package and everything, but I think they were recycled or somebody left them out in the rain or something.  If that thing slapped shut on my hand (which it tried to do like nine times), I know for sure I would have had to go get a tetnis shot, rabies, AIDS (the new AIDS shot, coming soon), and a pink eye shot.  That thing was more disease ridden than (insert skanky girl name from your high school, ex-girlfriend/boyfriend, or Pamela Anderson's name here).  This has been a friendly public service announcement reminding you not to ever set a mouse trap because they're very scary and will probably result in you crying a lot because you're not quite as manly as I am.  Email me  urlLink here  for story ideas, suggestions, or to agree with me on just how frightening mouse traps are."

"I'm sitting at home trying to be inspired by something.  Anything.  My day was fine - dressed up as the Cat in the Hat, and had a ball doing it.  And so what?  Why am I like this right now?  I don't enjoy being here by myself.  Loki is great, but does not compensate for real people.  I am thinking that some open mics may be in my near future.  Or something - anything.  I want to be passionate about something again.  Something real.  Something true.  And the Vernon Chorale rehearsal I'm supposed to be at tonight isn't doing it.  And I don't know why.    This is ridiculous.  I need to do something crazy and break out of this shell."

"I got this e-mail from a friend a long time ago, and just yesterday I was scrolling through some of my old ones and found this. I don't think it meant much at the time, but it does now...    Paul Harvey Writes:   We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse. For my grandchildren, I'd like better.   I'd really like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meat loaf sandwiches. I really would.   I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being cheated.   I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car.   And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen.   It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old dog put to sleep.   I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in.   I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother/sister. And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room,but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him.   When you want to see a movie and your little brother/sister wants to tag along, I hope you'll let him/her.   I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely.   On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone as uncool as your Mom.   If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying one.   I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books.   When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract in your head.   I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a boy\girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like.   May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.   I don't care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don't like it. And if a friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend.   I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma/Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle.   May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.   I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through your neighbor's window and that she hugs you and kisses you at Hannukah/Christmas time when you give her a plaster mold of your hand.   These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work and happiness. To me, it's the only way to appreciate life."
"I just checked, and it's not *'d out...yet.  Also, I changed something from their template.

"MoveOn is running a campaign to put ads on in Texas at  urlLink this site .  Here is the letter from Sen. Rodney Ellis that I was sent in an e-mail plea from MoveOn:  August 18, 2003 Dear friends,  I am writing to you from a hotel room in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where I and 10 of my colleagues in the Texas Senate have been forced to reside for the past 20 days. If we return to our homes, families, friends, and constituents, the Governor of Texas will have us arrested.  I know, it sounds more like a banana republic than the dignified democracy on which we have long prided ourselves. We are effectively exiled from the state due to our unalterable opposition to a Republican effort -- pushed by Tom Delay and Karl Rove, and led by Texas Governor Rick Perry -- that would rewrite the map of Texas Congressional districts in order to elect at least 5 more Republicans to Congress.  You may not have heard much about the current breakdown in Texas politics. The Republican power play in California has obscured the Republican power play in Texas that has forced my colleagues and me to leave the state.   Recognizing that public pressure is the only thing that can break the current stalemate, our friends at MoveOn have offered to support our efforts by sharing this email with you. In it, you will find:  Background information on how the situation in Texas developed;  Analysis of what's at stake for Democrats and the democratic process; and  How you can help by contacting Texas politicians, signing our petition, contributing funds, and forwarding this email!   The Republican redistricting effort shatters the tradition of performing redistricting only once a decade immediately after the Census -- making redistricting a perpetual partisan process. It elevates partisan politics above minority voting rights, in contravention of the federal Voting Rights Act. It intends to decimate the Democratic party in Texas, and lock in a Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. And Republican efforts to force a vote on this issue by changing the rules of legislative procedure threaten to undermine the rule of law in Texas.  We do not take lightly our decision to leave the state. It was the only means left to us under the rules of procedure in Texas to block this injustice. We are fighting for our principles and beliefs, and we can win this fight with your support.  Sincerely,  Rodney Ellis Texas State Senator (Houston)"
"Everything I Say Gets Ignored.   What up, peeps?  New week, same shit.  Endless incoherent ramblings of a vaugely eremitic mad(ish)man.  Howzabout you?  I bet you're wondering where I was yesterday... huh?  You're not?  At all?  Fair enough.  My new job has its high points, but mostly it sucks.  I can't quit though, cause I've only been doing it for a week and a half.  I have to give it and myself some time.  Maybe it will get less sucky when I get better at it.  And if it doesn't, well, then I'll quit.    This week (or what's left of it) I think I will bombard you with inconsequential details about my life in the fun and interesting form of top ten lists.  Mostly I'm doing this because all the creative energy is being sucked out of my brain like a lamprey on the belly of a shark and I haven't had an original thought in maybe 2 weeks.

"Oklahoma...OK  So, I have been out of pocket for a while.&nbsp; Sorry for the silence.&nbsp; Last week our middle schoolers took a mission trip to Anadarko, OK.&nbsp; The trip went well.&nbsp; At first the group didn't want to work, but they really rose to the occasion.&nbsp; I've observed a few things over the years while working with middle schoolers.&nbsp; First, they are much more capable than we give them credit for.&nbsp; They can lead, work hard, and be extremely creative.&nbsp; Secondly, they still need someone to guide them, encourage them and work alongside them.&nbsp; I love mission trips because you get to be with students all the time.&nbsp; You get to observe how they work and how they react to a variety of situations.&nbsp; I think the time of intensity opens so many doors to get into the lives of students like no other experience.&nbsp; I think that is why monastaries were so popular for a long time.&nbsp; On a mission trip the group forms a mini community that is serving with a purpose.&nbsp; On some level it makes me want to take a group of 20 students and permanently live out in a foreign country...then again I don't like students  that &nbsp;much."

"If the first story wasn't garbage enough, here's more for you   Great, now Ashcroft's involved.  apparently Toronto garbage is a  urlLink terrorist threat .  Or at least a threat to American Homeland Security.    Michigan legislators drafted a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking them to investigate the process by which garbage is imported across the boarder.  They cite recent \"drug\" and \"medical waste\" shipments that were hidden in Canadian garbage trucks.  Once again, we are coming to a crisis point with our garbage.  2 of the top 3 candidates insist that we can divert our waste to the point where virtually no landfill space will be required.  Neither of those two candidates indicate how long it will take to ramp up their diversion efforts so we can begin a \"phase out of garbage to Michigan\".

Even tonight, when I actually got off work at 1030, and I had all of that evening time stretching out before me.... I stayed to help out Cole and went to get a snack with him. Its so late now that I know I won't retain anything... maybe I'll just take a nap and work on this in the morning.   I only have myself to blame........ but I don't regret a minute of the time I've spent with my friend who is visiting from out of town this week. :)"
"Big, big, big thumbs up to \"Shattered Glass,\" the movie about Stephen Glass, the writer for The New Republic who made stuff up.  Along with \"Spellbound,\" it's one of my top two movies of the year, no doubt.  If you write -- or even just if you read -- it's a great two hours spent, basically right there in The New Republic's newsroom.  Rich, compelling drama.  But don't take my word for it.  Read  urlLink any review you want .  If I felt more ambitious this evening, I'd write up something longer.  But instead of a movie review, how about a Thanksgiving review?  Or at least a Thanksgiving review template.  I'd like to propose my very own Thanksgiving Ranking System:  There are four key aspects to any Thanksgiving meal.  1. The Food (subcategories: turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce) 2. The People (subcategories: youth, adult, adult-plus) 3. The Conversation (subcategories: current events, sports, all about you) 4. The Aftermath (subcategories: bathroom, leftovers, personal grudges renewed)  Each of the three subcategories that makes up one of the \"Magic Four\" gets a score between -10 and +10, inclusive.  The scores are then added up and divided appropriately to give a score for each of the four categories and then an overall Thanksgiving Day score.    Again, if I felt more ambitious, I'd rate my own Thanksgiving.  But I had a good time, and nothing funny happened, so it wouldn't be a very interesting story.  Other people who actually have terribly dysfunctional families where holidays are a chore would be better equipped to wring comic value from their Thanksgivings.  Mine was solid.  Good food, no problems.  Go see \"Shattered Glass.\"  Trust me on this one."
"HA! The band that I hate more than any other band, except for one (KISS) has broken up. That hairy-chested guido singer and the group of vagina pilots that we know as \"Creed\" is done. It's over. HA!  My hate for Creed and their brand of Jesus-infused cock-rock started many years ago when I heard them for the first time, at Edgefest. I was so disgusted that I tossed a bottle of sunscreen at the stage. It hit the singer right in the face. Initally, I felt bad, but after their second ablum came out, I felt as if he had finally gotten me back for that toss. For me, Creed is like second hand smoke; I didn't have any real control over it lingering in the air, but it killed me just a little bit on the inside everytime I was around it.   Working at HMV didn't make my hate for Creed any easier. Espeically in the 3 months where the manager thought it would be a really good idea to BLAST the music as loud as we could to get 'the vibe' going. Creed came out just around that time. Plus, people would always ask me if I liked Creed, and I would always tell them the truth and then they would get mad. I should note that Creed t-shirts only come in sleeveless.   Alright. Now hopefully the members of KISS will start dying. Then again, they are fairly entertaining, what with trying to sell you \"Kiss Kaskets\" and making comments about how Islam is a 'disgusting' religion. Yeah. Keep making comments like that, Gene, and you'll end up in your own KISS Kasket. GAH!"

"The universe is popping all over the place. Riccardo Giacconi, 1984.   Riccardo Giacconi just got the Nobel Prize in Physics  \"for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources\".

"Stephanie had 30 freebies for a show, so of course I wound up amongst a lot of familiar faces whose names I had forgotten (as I'm sure they forgot mine) 10 seconds after we were introduced three years ago.  But I made nice.  I smiled at everybody.  And when I ran into Horace (him, I've \"known\" for at least 10 years) in the subway afterwards, I was able to check myself when I found myself about to sit and ponder whether and how best to say, \"So, whatcha been up to lately?\"  Actually, I said the far cooler, \"So, do you have any projects in the works?\"  And, as it turns out, he soon will start rehearsal for a Broadway play called \"Brooklyn\" so I have to remember to go see it."
"Last month, I picked up a copy of Asylum Years, an anthology of songs by Tom Waits. For various reasons, I really haven't been able to listen to the CD - until last night. With my flatmate and his rock hardliner buddies out of the picture, I could play the album at the volume that any new piece of music deserves to be explored at.   I really don't know too much about Tom Waits - my only previous experience has been a single song I heard at a friends place more than a year back. I don't even remember much about that song. In fact I have no rational idea at all why I shelled out a tidy 525 rupees for the CD. All I can say is, thank Zark for good instincts.  The gravelly voice, the sardonic, poetic, tender, cruel lyrics, the smooth, sly jazzy background music - oh yes. I like it very good. I have a feeling Waits is going to be another trip for me like Nick Cave and Leonard Cohen. I suppose I should be writing about this in a more profound, critically perceptive way, but really, it's just some songs that I enjoyed listening to."
"Derrek called me this morning.  Wahoo!  I keep breaking into a huge grin every time I think about him, something he's said, or anything related to anything to do with him.  I think I may get to spend Friday with him in addition to Saturday now.  I mentioned teaching him how to dance, and he's actually up for it.  He's either open-minded about doing things (bonus) or he'll do things just to spend time with me (also bonus).   He teases me about where I work, and calls it a \"compound\" because I live here, and there are bunk houses.  (They run a summer camp here.)  He said this morning that he looked it up online, and said the facade of us being an art camp even holds up there.  He looked up my work online!  I never even gave him the address.  Somebody's thinking about me... I'm smiling.  On a different note... upon further reflection I decided that Venesuela was definetly a yellow, and not a yellow/blue.  Intamacy was just his source for fun, and not a motivator."

"Columbia has fallen upon such evil days that a man cannot be safe unless he is wicked.  Even those in a position to protest against the perniciousness which they see about them dare not speak lest they make matters worse than before. So the poor are despoiled, the widows sigh, the orphans are oppressed, until many of them, born of families not obscure, and liberally educated, flee to our enemies, flee to the distant, flickering stars, so that they may no longer suffer the oppression of public persecution. Our populace rides our elevators to planets and stars beyond, leaving those too poor and too barbaric to pay our taxes in money darkened by blood.  They leave a Planet in anarchy for a Solar System in upheaval.  They doubtless seek Columbian humanity among the offworlders, because they cannot bear offworlder inhumanity among the Columbians. And although they differ from the people to whom they flee in manner and in language; although they are unlike as regards the fetid odor of the offworlders' bodies and garments and habitations, they would rather endure a foreign civilization among the offworlders than cruel injustice among the Columbians.   So they migrate to feared cities and habitats, such as Bythinia; a mining hovel bathed in Jupiters shadow, such as Salutar; one of our many colonies in open revolt, a fester of brigandry, such as any world stained by the Kaedans.  They exile themselves, and do not regret their exile.  For they would rather live free under an appearance of slavery than live as captives under an appearance of liberty.  Such a crisis has not befallen the homeworld since the terror-fecund days of the Exodus, and the Eleven Wars. --Salvator Lin, Introduction to Zeitgeist"

"There was a ding dong of a door bell I didnt know existed. The farm has a doorbell? Well whadda know, I thought. Arent you going to get that?\" Catherine looked at me with impatience and a face that said cant you see Im busy.   Hi. (there are 2 strangers at the door) Hi. You must be? Im Anitas daughter, Jillian. And you must be Im Darlene. Im a friend of Agnes. Is she here? No, I think shes gone into town. My sister and I woke up to find no one here. (Thinking since were having a reunion, they must be distant relatives.) Do you want to come in?  They came in and then Darlene sprung it on me, the real reason she was at the door. They were messengers of God, coming to spread the word. No, they werent my family after all. Not in the sense that I thought. The Jehovahs Witnesses out here on a farm in the middle of gorgeous nowhere? To my perplexment, I found myself entertaining these 2 nice women. So for the next 20 minutes, I politely listened to the word of God being channeled through them and accepted their offer to read me scriptures proving the world is coming to an end. Then without hesitation I told them that I believed that once there was a God but now he is gone.   Nonetheless, I reluctantly accepted her card and the pamphlet encouraging me to save myself (which happens to be published in 254 languages and tells me what exactly God requires of me. I think the real question that needs to be answered is What is God willing to do that  I require of him). I promised, albeit with my fingers crossed behind my back which everyone from childhood knows protects you from the almighty wrath of God for lying, to call. Which I wont.   Im a bad girl."

"Hmm, what's a good rant topic? Fear and religion. Yes. Heh, no offense is meant anywhere, mind you. I met someone in mythology class last semester who said he would rather suffer unfathomable pain than die. Because he was athiest, he believed when he died, there would be nothing more... lack of existence. I understand the logic behind that, I suppose, but it conflicts my views rather... violently. I have always been in awe of religion throughout human existence- civilization. Worship of some sort is apparent in thousands of cultures, millions even, over the years of civilization. As I see it, there are three possible reasons for this. Maybe two... hard to say if the last fits w/ the others. 1) There is some higher power above humanity, and humans have found out about this in multiple societies. 2) Humans are driven by a fear of death that surrounds them- afterlife is created to dissipate this fear, and gods are created over the years to explain away natural occurences, seen as phenomena. 3) Human nature calls for a need of order, some heirarchy to keep things in line. Mythologies are created for this purpose, as well as fear of death.   Now we're clear on that... the rant part. Why fear death so much? You look at different beliefs, and unless you've been a horrible person and you know you've been \"evil,\" and you're going to hell in your mind... or some similar place- I mean, why else would you spend every single day of your life avoiding death. It happens everyday, it's natural... keeps the population down. Suffering I can understand, of course. No one likes pain. Scratch that, few people like pain. But death... especially if you don't believe in your classic afterlife of happiness/unhappiness. If you don't exist, you're not going to care much.   *note to self: rant on good and evil soon"

"I was just reading an  urlLink article about Jabberwocky  on TheFeature. It's a piece of software that runs on your cell phone or PDA and uses Bluetooth to identify your  urlLink familiar strangers . Basically it just looks for other Bluetooth devices that are broadcasting their IDs and records them, and provides a display that lets you look at just how often and where you keep meeting these people/devices again and again. What's the range of Bluetooth? The official web site promises that the  urlLink range of Bluetooth  is 10 meters but the Bluetooth SIG has always been overly optimistic about what it can and/or will do. That's enough to scan cars next to you on the road, especially in a traffic jam. I've often wondered what cars I commonly share the road with. This is almost by itself major impetus to get a cell phone.  I wonder how the privacy groups and EFF and whatnot will take this? Any sort of unique ID on a user is anathema to them. There could be some very sinister applications of this idea. Imagine writing a virus (well... trojan more likely) in Java to monitor someone's movements. It would infect as many phones as possible, and whenever it locates the target sends a message back to the originator. Okay, so that's far-fetched. But I'm sure there's some way that this could be very very bad. Jabberwocky is open sourced and written using J2ME for MIDP 2.0, I could download it and see how to do the Bluetooth stuff and try to write an app myself based on such an idea.  PBS has a re-run of Austin City Limits with Nickel Creek on today. They're a sort of bluegrass-influenced band. Insanely cool - I first heard of them on Prairie Home Companion. I think the guy plays a yukalalee (a Google search confirms that I spelled that right - weird huh?). But it could equally well be a banjo, the same search mentioned that a yukalalee is either a type of banjo or vice versa. You know, it would probably have been smarter to Google for \"Nickle Creek\" than \"yukalalee\"... I suppose with near infinite information at your fingertips urlLink *  you have to draw the line somewhere though (re: how much detail you're willing to drill down into).  Another thought: I need to find an email client supporting IMAP that I can live with. I currently use Outlook 2000 but I can't stand it because the IMAP support is single-threaded! I'm not kidding, just trying to open up a message locks the application! This is utterly intolerable because at home I'm still on dialup.  I so need to get broadband. Dialup seriously limits my ability to read articles and generally muck about listlessy online. It's also one of the things that went seriously wrong with the masjid school finances.  Hey!

Anyways one can be both a Linux fan as well as a Microsoft fan, especially since I'm not a UNIX fan. Die, commercial UNIX, die!"

"Does anyone notice how unusually fast time has been passing lately?   It's almost the end of the week once again. July flew by faster that I thought imaginable. So many dates, and goals and things that I thought I would have during the month, I have not yet come to do. All I have done was simply push back all the plans and crammed it to the last 10 days of the month and am now facing the consequences of being a lazybum.   Stuck in a tornado field at the moment. My mind spins in all directions, picking up everything around me and being my own big plasma membrane - taking in what I need and pushing out what I don't need. Only thing is, my cell's plasma membrane actually knows what it's doing. I have no idea whatsoever. All the taking in and excreting have no connection, no use, no facts. I'm just doing what I feel is right. And that's usually never good as I'm 99.9% of the time dead-flat wrong.   I go around feeding myself fallacies I've created on my own.  \"Kim, you're fine.\"  \"Kim, you've got this under control.\"  \"Kim, you'll be okay.

The kind we go through atleast 2438473 times a year - only difference is we all take it differently. I, as we can all tell, don't take it as winsome as I should. I choose to be weak and just drown in my melange of complication, depression and anxiety.   I'll snap out of it eventually.  Hopefully anyways.  It's been a good month. Not so good with the rush and everything - but nothing I can complain about.&nbsp; It was rather mild but somehow rather ... disturbing. I'll never understand these things. I'll never know how to explain it either.   Maybe I'm right about the phase. About the lonely phase we often get. Everythings so loud, everyone's pretty much everywhere; yet you're in a glass bubble. You're alone and you're unheard.   THAT or I'm listening to too many angsty, lost, and sad music.&nbsp;"

"Why I believe that taxation is a form of slavery.  OK, Ive taken a beating on the piracy thing, and Im going to respond to all of you here in a few moments.  But I realize that I cant effectively respond until I offer a satisfactory rationale for why I believe that any form of taxation (as well as any form of theft) is really a form of enslavement.  And in my mind, slavery is one of the worst crimes imaginable.  I need to try to explain this in a way to get through to Steve, because he isnt buying the argument.  Taxation is a means by which the government extracts money from the citizens to use in whatever way they see fit.  The government cannot spend one dime without taking that money from another person.  We have all become too comfortable with the concept that the money taken from us was never really ours to begin with.  How many people know how much you pay in taxes?  Do you know your gross pay, or your net?  The missing money isnt even on your radar, so you dont really worry about it.    What is your pay?  It represents the time and labor you have traded.  You come into work and produce a product or man a computer, and your employer provides money in exchange for this activity.  Yet, the taxman steps in and takes a chunk of your money, representing your time and labor.    Lets make it more obvious by changing things a little.  Lets say Dave travels the town repairing heating and air conditioning units.  At the end of each job, he is handed food, or CDs, or some other good that he wants.  Each time he works, he gets something that meets his needs.  But at the end of every day, he has to go visit one customer and spend a quarter of his day working there.  At the end of that job, he is shoved out the door for no compensation.  He is requires by law to work for this customer every day, without being paid.  He MUST do this because society has said he must give his time without pay.  Society has established ownership over a large chunk of Daves life.  The faceless mob is saying that they have the right to own the product of your labor, and you have no choice but to comply.  Is this not slavery?  But you say that as a society, we have decided to accept this.  So therefore it is a happy slavery, one entered into with eyes open and hearts light.  We happily toil for the good of us all, casting aside our individuality for the betterment of the group.    Before I address this, I have to lie out another point.  The most fundamental of human rights is the idea of freedom.  As free men, we answer to no one else when it comes to what we do with our own time and labor.  Provided we do not infringe upon the basic human rights of others, we are free to do whatever we choose.  Being free means not being owned by anyone, including society.  The mob has no claim on the labor of a free man.  Therefore, while you might say we are laboring for the good of society, that decision has been taken from us.  Collectively, we vote for representatives who then decide to tax us for whatever program might be popular.  However, if a man votes that he does not wish to contribute his labor towards a particular thing, his wishes are ignored should the mob decide to support the taxation.  The mans right to own himself has been taken from him, and a burden is placed on his labor.  Suddenly, Dave has to work a little longer for the non-paying customer, regardless of Daves desire to do so.  The only just system taxes the willing.  Those that vote to tax themselves should be taxed.  Those that chose to be free, should be free.  You might complain that under such a system, no programs will be funded, and no one would ever be taxed.  I answer by saying YES.  That is the goal.  People should be free to determine for themselves where their money should be spent.  Should a man choose to hand 20% of his money to PBS, he is free to do so.  Should another man decide to invest his money in a new business that is his decision as well.  Only by the free choice of free men, we can have a just society.    The very concept of a majority vote enslaving the unwilling is anathema to my beliefs.  What is wrong with the prospect that self-ownership cannot be taken away?  Why do we accept that 50% + 1 vote has the right to consign us to work for the non-paying customer?    For the good of society?  For the benefit of all?  Again, who owns you? Are you an individual or are you a part of a group?  I submit that we all can do more for society by pursuing our own self interests.  Any takers on that debate?  Any form of taxation to support a program that you do not agree with is slavery.  Pure and simple.  If you state that this is a necessity of life, then all I ask is for you to admit that slavery itself is a necessary evil.  Acknowledge that the fundamental premise of taxation policy is no better than 17th century slavery."

"Got this in my inbox this morning ( urlLink Daily Dig from Bruderhof ): A Matter of Life and Death William Willimon  The church of today lives in an ethically debilitating climate. Where did we go wrong? Was it the urbane self-centeredness of Peale's \"Power of Positive Thinking\" and its therapeutic successors? Was it the liberal, civic-club mentality of the heirs to the Social Gospel? Now we waver between evangelical TV triumphalism with its Madison Avenue values or live-and-let-live pluralism which urges open-mindedness as the supreme virtue. And so a recent series of radio sermons on \"The Protestant Hour\" urged us to \"Be Good to Yourself.\" This was followed by an even more innocuous series on \"Christianity as Conflict Management.\" Whatever the gospel means, we tell ourselves, it could not mean death. Love, divine or human, could never exact something so costly. After all, our culture is at least vestigially Christian. Isn't that enough?  The answer to that last question is of course \"no\" - and I agree that we have watered down the Gospel into something of a self-help mantra. How many people sitting in pews every Sunday are deceived into thinking they've got hell-fire insurance, when in reality they've only bought into a humanistic form of religion? We've bought into form over substance - doing the right things, looking the right way, having the right attitude, and never really dying to themselves and living to Christ.  God is mercifully patient with us (2 Peter 8-10, where Pastor Mike read last night; Romans 2:4), giving us plenty of time to turn this thing around and repent. But we're the blind leading the blind, and too many of us are falling into the pit (Matt 15:14). Darkness was allowed to stay - light didn't shine somewhere along the line, and we got used to the shadows.Would someone turn on the lights? Would someone be bold enough to play by the rules, to learn from the Master how to really live in the kingdom? There's no room for wishy-washy Christians any more. If it's going to be real, then we'll have to be real.  Practically, what does this mean? We need to BE more, not just DO more, or TRY more. Instead of thinking \"I need to pray more\" - just pray more. Instead of thinking \"I need to study my Bible\" - just do it. Instead of asking \"why am I not sharing Jesus with folks?\" - just talk Him up. For me, living it out is a whole lot more fruitful than thinking about it or having guilt over a lack of it. I want to BE a person who does those things - not someone trying to live up to a standard, but who's living life through the standard...  I'm through preaching now :)"

"My computer is semi-dead. I have no idea, really. We'll see when I get home tonight.  Well. This has been quite the last few days. Lots of craziness. But right now I'm a bit disappointed because it looks like I'm going to have to end one of my longest friendships in Australia. I've tried to remain friends with this person, but frankly, I don't have the energy or the patience or the time to deal with their bullsh*t. I don't claim innocence here. I'm know I haven't handled things particularly well either, but at least I've made some effort. So yeah, I'm disappointed that it's come to this. And I'm sorry to say that age doesn't necessarily bring widsom or maturity. I'm the 'baby' in this friendship and yet I've managed to be the 'grown-up'  for the most part. In retrospect I should have handled things differently, but looking back I also realise that the ending would have been the same, no matter the path I chose to take. I've taken the scenic route when I should have taken the short-cut, but I've learned a lot along the ride. And I just wouldn't be me if I cut to the chase instead of letting the story drag out.   I've been thinking a lot lately about the type of person I am and the type of person I enjoy being. I take full responsibility for my actions and words when I am in any context, but more and more I notice how some people just really are more conducive to bringing out the best in you while others are more skilled in helping to bring out the worst in you. Like I said, my behaviour is still up to me, no matter who I am around, but I can't deny that I am a better me in the presence of certain people, while others, as much as I care about them, only seem to drag me down. The other night I met this person who had a real knack for getting me going in a good way. You know those nights when you're out at a party or gathering and you're just fully switched on? You're an intensive version of you - comfortable, laid-back, attentive, outspoken, you're just in your groove. Well it was a nice reminder that there are still people out there I can be like that with. With this above-mentioned friend, I've felt boring and stale and inhibited. Certainly not a version of me I want to be.  I've got Jeff Buckley's 'Last Goodbye' playing in my head right now....it's been nice knowing you, my friend, even when things weren't very nice...."

Point? none. - had to make run for the car since was 18 degrees outside and units decided would be smart to park in bumblefuck  Highlights: - saw really REALLY great shoes ON SALE, is likely will go back asap - when dad complained about cold fish, seemed to break perky waiter's spirit. Trs amusant. - one waiter looked exactly like Jeff from Coupling and seemed to have personality to match. - Manicotti was really good. - dad's food was cold. bahaha. - after we ordered our food our waiter said, AND I QUOTE, \"ah, great.

She went to Ft.Worth and had lunch with my mom and while she was at lunch I prepared her birthday display on the table. Nothing to big, I am watching the pennies, and she knew that. I got her a dozen roses, some chocolate/vanilla fudge, and a charm braclet that she was wanting. I also bought a Royal red velvet cake and she said it was yummy. Oh, and lastly - I got her first \"To My Wife\" Birthday Card. :)  After all that, we went out to Grapevine Lake with James for some speed boat fun. James had bought a wake board, but no one knew how to ride it, so I had to figure it out. It took me about 5 tried to get up, but I finally figured it out. I have to say it is a lot easier than skiing and tons more fun. I dunno if the skateboarding as a kid helped out at all, but I felt totally more comfortable on the board. I'm not saying I didn't royally bust my ass, I landed on my face a few times. Alot of the time! The fun factor out weighted the pain, so it was cool. MiMi just chilled out in the boat, she seems to just enjoy getting out and doing something - I do too.  When we first got out to the lake and taxi'd out of the 'no wake' area - it started to pour rain.  I just laughed and said \"Happy Birthday mimi, you gotta have an interesting memory for your 21st birthday..\" The rain lasted at the most 15min - and we were sailing again.

"It Didn't Blow... It Sucked   I stayed up late last night watching \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" and then I watched Robert Plant on \"Austin City Limits\" (an amazing performance) before I finally took the trash out and headed to bed. It must've been around 2am before I got into bed.  Not having any AC was awful. I can't open my window, so the only air I got was from a tiny fan I usually keep in the bathroom and my shitty fan that blows air out of it's sides. The ceiling fan was on too, but I have to keep it on low or else it clicks all night. It took a long time before was comfortable enough to fall asleep and then after I fell asleep, I kept waking up, sweating. It really, really sucked.   I was up before 10am today. I won another auction last night while I \"slept\". This one was for 36 tapes and I got it fot $5. No shipping either, since they live here in Clearwater. I just have to go pick them up. I am also negotiating with a seller on his lot of 300+ tapes that ended without the reserve being met. He wants $75 plus shipping but I'm only willing to go $50  including  shipping since he didn't include a picture of the tapes (so I can guage what shape they're in). I may or may not get it. It's a killer lot too, some  great  titles, about 60 I really want. I don't think he'll do it for $50 though, unfortunately.  Oh yeah, the AC. Mike, a family friend who fixes AC's, had me try the air this morning and it's working again. It must've just frozen up yesterday. He's going to come by and put some freon in it later today. He's also going to bring his guitar with him (he just started learning how to play) so I can teach him some stuff.   Later on, I hope to get some auctions listed on eBay. With all the auctions I've been winning, I can definitely use the extra money. I've said that the last few weeks too, so... we shall see."

That a Republican would be so concerned shows this is not a partisan issue, though Democrats may wish to paint it that way and many Republicans feel they have to defend the Administration.  I agree with Graham.  Take this head on.  Address the systemic issues in ways that will solve them.  Don't just be defensive, because this issue will not and should not \"just go away.\""

"Planned to wake up at 7.30a.m. today, and of course, the alarm did woke me up, but I went back to sleep again for another 30 minutes. In the end, my mom woke me up when she said that she had prepared my breakfast! Although in a rush, I spent quite a long time thinking of what I should wear. I just bought a new shirt from TopMan yesterday just to use the bloody RM25 voucher that expires tomorrow! Well, I went out today to SMK Puteri Ampang, near AmpWalk to attend their International Cum Installation Day.  ~ It starts at 9.30a.m. and I was late since I woke up at 8.00a.m. as I left my house at 8.45a.m. to take LRT. It doesn't go right to the place, so I had to change to Putra at Masjid Jamek. The school is quite far from Ampang Park. Walking there made me sweat a lot. So I decided to stop by AmpWalk to get a drink and to dry off my sweat. When I reached the school, it was quite empty from the outside as everyone was in the hall already. I was greeted by 2 interactors at the registration counter and they asked me to register. I wrote down my name and my position. The girl was quite shocked when she knew that I'm the President. And she asked me am I the only one who will be attending, and as usual, yes. They charged me RM6 as I'm interactor, although I wasn't wearing my Interact uniform. And they gave me a piece of tissue also, how kind of them to do so!  The theme for their event was Vision Through Darkness. For that, the hall was very dark. When I entered it, I could hardly see a thing except the stage. I simply sat at my place and in coincidence, Cheng Han was just 2 rows in front of me. When I was there, I already missed out the roll call, the singing of the national anthem, the interact song and speeches. Luckily I didn't miss the opening ceremony. Right after that, it was time for entertainment. Oh yea, I noticed that the backdrop was really nice. So, the performances started with a drama. It was nice. Better than ours. It was quite meaningful, but the story seems like a paste from a story that I read from electronic mail. After that, they had a dance by Britney and Madonna wannabes. So the song was none other than \"Me Against the Music\".  ~ Time for refreshment came and everyone went to the canteen. They served fried mee hoon, curry vege-chicken, normal chicken nuggets, spicy chicken nuggets, jellys and cin cau. The nuggets were finishing very fast and we all took about 50 of them! Then, I went to their exhibition hall. They did a lot of research and work on it. But I have a thought. Once I entered the room, I thought I entered a sauna or something as they lit up a lot of candles in the room. Being in the room for 5 minutes made me sweat a lot. So I decided to snap 1 or 2 pictures and ciao as quickly as possible.   After that, I went back into the hall for more entertainment. This time around, a girl sang \"There You'll Be\" by Faith Hill. She's a really good singer, but the mic went on and off. So the performance wasn't that good. Then, I think it was time for the African Dance. It was awesome. I wished I could have joined them. Hm... what else. Oh yea, the fashion show. It was a short one but antertaining enough. The performances ended with a song and dance performance by a group of incoming and outgoing interactors. And guess what, they used the song \"She Bangs\" by William Hung. Of course, everyone laughed at them.   ~ Then, their installation took place. And right after that, it was time for presentation of souvenirs to the guests. The fellowship was canceled, so that was the end of it. Before I went off, I got Ee Vonn's contact. She's the new President for that Club. She's cool, smsed her for quite a while and she sounded very friendly to me.  Here are some of the pictures taken during the event:    Hot! Hot! Hot!     But the idea was still brilliant!     Draculas attack!     Angel of Sadness!     Angels of Love!     Angels of Happiness!     Angels of Beauty!     The last angel!     This is their souvenir. Not bad at all.      The program book (the butterfly stick), the bracelet (souvenir to the guest) and glow-in-the-dark stick."

"Hey well you know, uh, yeah. The ignoring thing is really working out for me, ignore your problems with booze and constant living on the streets, forget you have a home a mother who thinks you're fucking for a living (Mum, what are you talking about?, no really) and forget everything that you think you oughta have and just be happy with what you've got. Spent all last night drawing and boy, I drew the best John Lennon type drawing (What does that mean, Been?) and a picture of a gothed up Ron, I honestly think he would be such a Sex Pistol.

Tarot reading is actually quite an art and I enjoy doing it, I really respect the cards, I think the cards are actually quite spiritual, or perhaps I think I'm more perceptive than I originally thought I was...Gee that's a side of me some people don't understand, the whole trying to understand the world through a mystical sense, it just makes more sense to me than the whole economical rationalisation, you know, sorry. Sorry Sorry, but you know I'm just trying me out and it doesn't matter to me, if no one understands. None of their fucking concern anyways.

"[16019]   Now playing:  Weezer 's  Blue Album: Deluxe Edition  (specifically the accoustic version of Jamie)  I haven't heard that version since high school, when I borrowed one of Brandon's Weezer singles. I was listening to my new CDs while waiting for the bus at Walmart yesterday, and I couldn't help but remember listening to Weezer on the little hill infront of small gym back in Irvine High waiting for rides home. The summer before sophmore year and doing that for some reason is the most vivid. I remember listening to my mix tape with Weezer and Bad Religion on it. This was Weezer's  Blue  and taped versions of singles off Brandon's single and the Undone single I had bought myself. I was also listening to  Bad Religion 's  Stranger than Fiction  a lot. By the end of summer, I'll have gotten  Generator  and been listening to that a lot too.   I didn't get into the  Descendents  until later in high school... until after I bought  Somery  maybe at the end of my junior? I think I bought it was Circuit City...   Most of the CDs I bought in high school were from Tower Records in Tustin, and I think possibly one or two from the Wherehouse... now most of the ones I buy are from Amazon.com.  I feel kind of good that the bands I liked in high school are still active. I wasn't listening to any one hit wonders.  Oh for those of you don't know, I'm learning how to rollerblade to get my ass out of my chair and go out and enjoy spring weather.

Back to the coffee...Toby's coffee is so delicious it doesn't even need sugar (bah to sugar! however I'm an addict so I'll put sugar in anything. Don't test me on that btw.) I've been drinking Toby's coffee now for about three weeks, and this is the first Bag of coffee that I brought. BeanieD told Been (who told me) to put in MILK and SUGAR at the bottom of the cup and then pour the coffee. Well...what I did was put in one teaspoon of sugar and about two dollops of milk and and then whisk it together to form foamy sugary milk and then pour the hot steaming freshly brewed coffee...if you are not converted by then, you have a heart of stone and GET OUT GET OUT! I found out yesterday as well that there is an IVY fanlisting, can you imagine? Now Ivy is Isabella Valentine, a playable character in Namco's amazing game \"Soul Calibur II\" and one of my best fighting talents.

She is basically a special moves only character, you just can't horizontally/vertically slash someone with her, she will end up on the floor in a minced heap. She just isn't that fast. What Ivy is best at doing is snaring her prey and fucking them up using complicated moves that are very difficult to get out of. Just last night I won 4 out of 5 games with her, she's just the best. I do urge anyone to go to  urlLink  here   and watch a few Ivy videos, however if you see her do some shit move it's not her it's her snot nosed controller, some players out there are just so godamn BAD. Anyways I'm going to be on the list and get a little image thing happening...it might sound really lame, but then again she's a hot domantrix with big tits, and I can live my fantasy can't I?

"I went out to a movie with Franklin last night. It was one of the Cocteau films at LACMA. Very weird, but not in a Cocteau way. Franklin was puzzled by it too. It was enjoyable in a staging/farce kind of way. I think that everything I go see with Franklin at LACMA is a stagy farce. The crowd there reacts so oddly too. They always laugh at really inappropriate parts, but in a smarmy way. It's not the respectful movie audience you would expect at a museum film series. I wonder why? After we went out for a drink at this Spanish place. I had sangria, which was pretty good. I hadn't talked to Franklin in a while. It was good. I got the cuff project out. It cost me $20 to ship, but it is done now. I'm kind of glad. Now if they don't print it I will be really mad. I want to start on the recycled tire project with Hae Won. I think about it all the time. It is such a good idea.  An almost infinitely renewable raw material resource that has never been incorprated into anything that interesting.

They said that Al Gore was a centrist Democrat and that Dean was much further left of him.  Do you agree with this?  If so, I am terrified to think that Dean might win the White House, as I have always considered Gore to be a fringe left wing loonie.  If Dean truly is left of Gore....  On a funny note, Dean is aparently raising most of his money via the internet.  If that is the case, he owes Al Gore two thank yous.  First for the endorsement.  But most importantly for the internet, because we all know that Al Gore invented the internet."
"Had a pretty nice time yesterday.  I asked a fellow colleague I got to know recently out to dinner, ok so it took me around 5 minutes to finally sum up the courage to give her a call but I did and she said yes.   I just love meeting new people. It's really interesting for me to hear other people's opinions and experiences about life, relationships, career goals etc. etc.  And sometimes the things they say make me look at a certain topic in a new light;   I guess there's a lot of things you can learn from other people.  But I always prefer one-to-one outings to like group outings , the conversations are just so much more personal and involved that way. But the minus side is that it is harder to meet new people compared to like group outings.   After the dinner I met two friends for drinks, we shared a mini-barrel and a jug of Heineken. Got as high as a kite and came back home and puked my dinner out. That kinda sucked.  Oh had a pretty interesting discussion amidst all that drinking, we were talking about how much the government sucked and didn't give a shit about the average singaporean, but one of them was like pro-government saying they had to raise prices of like everything during the recession otherwise the economy would die.  Finally we agreed to disagree on that.  And we also debated on the philosophical topic of S & M and where it was morally and socially acceptable. My opinion was as long all parties involved are willing I dun see a problem with it, which is my stand on most things.  But one of them felt that it was just \"wrong\"."

"Lock 'n Loll...   urlLink  Killing Heidi   ROCKED man! The gig was worth the 3 1/2 hour wait as 3 opening bands performed (KH came on at 11.55pm!!).  There we were, me and Debbie in the crowd up front as Charles, Jas and Kelly watched from an elevated step. Half the crowd in front of us were jumping up and down, the other half bopping, and the rest behind us watching with cool aloofness, while amidst all this stood two Asian girls head-banging their brains out, arms flailing about, looking like a cross between scarecrows on acid and chickens coming in for a landing. It was WILD. And it was Awesome. And it was pretty short - only about 1 hr long. We wanted MORE!!!  The gig left us on a natural high - Debbs wound the car window down and screamed into the night breeze, scaring the woman in the car next to us at the traffic light, while I just kept smiling and going \"Wooohooo!!\". A bunch of kookies we were. But we had SO much fun, and I haven't done this in a really long time, a couple of years in fact! So it was great to just let go at the gig, especially since we were anonymous beings in a sea of unknown faces. I'm sooooo glad I went, and sooooo glad that Debbie went too, to be my rockin' partner. 'Coz it's not really something you can do alone you know? You need a friend next to you, doing the same wild things, so you won't feel too insecure, even if there is a crowd of people around you.

"Did you see the Golden Globes last night?  Les testicles d'or?  (that's not really the french translation so calm down)   The show was good, straightforward, awards for performing, composing and writing.    I was disappointed that they parodied that OUTKAST song that is so cool and fun to listen to.  That will be the new movie trailer song.  That will be the new soundtrack to everything that is supposed to fun and lightheared.  That will be the new background music to commercials for Chevy pickup trucks and Babies' pullup potty training diapers.    I was glad to see that Renee Zelwegger's performance in Cold Mountain was duely recognized.  I was very happy for Bill Murray who not only deserved the Golden Globe but also deserves an Oscar for his performance in Lost in Translation.  Sofia Coppola earned her award as well.  At least, I think she won.  I was out cold some time after Bill Murray's funny speech.  About the fashion.  I didn't really see any dress that I didn't like with the exception of Nicole Kidman's.  That dress was odd.  I thought Diane Keaton looked the best in her white tuxedo dress accessorized with pearls and white satin gloves.  I'm glad she won as well.  She's always funny and never disappoints."

This is my last chance to pimp out my site before departure tomorrow so I'm taking it. GO  urlLink HERE  NOW!  And also add \"prolly\" , \"nurr\", \"Cya\"  and \"WoRdS wItH rAnDoM CaPiTaLiZaTiOn\" to the Echelon list of words that annoy Michael. Although my pointing that out will probably just make you say them more.  And Marten, the word \"subjugate\" will forever be dirty in my mind.  And Thomas, Sorry if I appeared dodgy, I thought you wanted one of my Twizzlers. And You would have had to have pried them out of my cold dead hands! And Sophia, I believe the quote is a misinterpretation of one of Maya Angelou's poem. The one where she's got oil wells digging in her back yard. Yeah, that one. (if you were in my 9H English class during the interpretive reading of that poem you saw Taylor Sheridan groping himself. Yeah, I wish I had missed it too.)  Does my sexiness offend you?"
"Porse and Jurquette Jet to Sydney to see Dizzee Rascal.  Friday 23rd of July  8am Zoe up and packing trying to decide whether or not to take suitcase just for one night. At least manage to narrow it down to two pairs of kicks. Ingest too much caffine via coffee and diet coke.  10am Porse awakens.  Takes Mersyndols.  This is an indication that he stayed up late the night before with Bru and Snax drinking beer and being a 24 hour hip hop b-boy or something.  10:30am  Boy In Da Corner goes on the CD player and much rump-shaking and yelling of east London slang ensues.  The excitement builds.  11am All packed and time to go - we hit the road.  12pm Arrive early at airport and score cool seats on plane.  Bonus! Gate no. is 40....very unlucky in HK.  1pm Take off!  2:25pm Landing!  3:15pm Check into hotel....great location but put on level 4 (yikes) in room 424!    4:00pm Find some Euros in room worth about 7 bucks.  Maybe not so unlucky after all apart from stench of chlorine filling room from pool just outside our door.  4:30pm Time for some room service.  I stick to Atkins diet ie a bit of cheese, Porse goes for the All Day Brekkie and a side of spicy wedges.  The wedges win.  5pm - 8pm Getting ready, showering, tarting up and checking out the Ryan eviction on Big Brother.  8:10pm Walk to venue expecting doors to be open as advertised.  8:30pm Meet lovely couple in line, Ross and Vanessa.  Time passes a little quicker.  Doors still not open.  9pm Doors finally open.  9:05pm Discover that Dizzee is not on until 12:30am.  Arse and bugger.  9:10pm Decide to have a few drinks.  Or more.   11:00pm Decide that I have seen Dizzee Rascal in the crowd.  Ask him his name and he says AJ.  Refuse to believe he is not him despite the fact he looks nothing like him.  11:10pm Get even more maggot.  What else was there to do??  I mean, 3 and a half fucking hours!!!  11:30pm Shit band comes on....still lucid but tired and bored of waiting for Dizzee.  Have some great chats with Vanessa inbetween assaulting the bar. Have fun dissing Blue Juice (the shit band) with new friends Ross and Vanessa.    12:30am -ish Dizzee comes on.  Spot we had staked out for hours gets bumrushed.  I venture into the \"mosh\" to get a better look.  Memory starting to flicker a bit by now and fatigue has set in.  12:45am Feeling overwhelmed by mosh, Porse takes me towards toilets to get a breather despite my initial resistance.  I spot some stairs and walk straight towards them to sit down and have a rest.....but I faint instead.  12:45:30sec Face plant into stairs, split chin open, blood everywhere.  Security call a taxi but I tell everyone I want to go home.  This does not work coming from a pissed, fainter on anti-depressant medication.  1am Arrive at RPA hospital.  1:05am - 3am  Fill in paperwork, get asked if I know where I am (fucking hospital, missing Dizzee!) and if I have taken any drugs (drugs are bad m'kay!!).  Porse tells them about my prescription stuff just to be safe.  Needed 3 stitches in chin.  Right knee bruised as fuck.  Given Tetnus injection for that extra pain factor.  3:15am  Back at hotel; need room service as possible cause for fainting - drinking on empty stomach with prescription meds.  10am Wake up feeling sorry for myself and sorry for Porse because we missed the show and sorry for workmate Ed because I was going to go to FCUK to get him a T-Shirt but was too buggered.  Not much else to tell.  Porse went to breakfast, we packed, got a taxi back to the hospital where Porse had dropped my watch from his backpack then onto the airport.  Uneventful flight back.  Disco nap for me and then being the hardcore motherfucking crazy party animal that I am generally not, we went to the Northern Soul 2nd Anniversary with Porse's mum and sisters plus Bru and Mon's friend.  Was a great night.  I drank, I danced and I did not faint once.  Currently wondering if this is anything to do with the fact that I stopped taking my lithium that very day? I am now convinced that it doesn't agree with me.   Stitches out tomorrow, woo hoo, but bruising is still pretty bad.  So much for checking out the cutting edge of the grime/eski scene.  More like the cutting edge of concrete stairs on my chin.  Still.  Mustn't grumble.  I definitely had a laugh before and after the 'incident'.  It just hurt more after.  Any news fellow jerks?"

"Such a nice thing to say, \"why hasn't anyone snatched you up yet?\" That's just made my day.  I wonder myself, or maybe I don't.  Guess I'm not out in the market enough or something, or is it too many walls of protection? Probably a bit of both, and a lot of the really slow on the uptake.  I don't pick up on hints, and when I do, figure nah, I'm misreading this, they're not interested. Maybe most people just don't know me, it takes time, and the perception they do have just isn't appealing. I'll find somebody though.  It'd be nice to have someone around. Yup, I'm on the prowl for a man, and it's not even hunting season.   ...meeting update: almost done, yahoo! Find me and bug me about deets about all the mini adventures.  I will say this, we found the best little bar I've ever seen, and I can only hope there's something comparable in the Washington area.  It's called BarBar, has two bars, two pool tables,and lots of open seating at tables and benches and couches.  Very open even though it's in a basement, and not cramped and crowded like throngs of folk in a 10ft wide room.  They have board games, yes, board games...we played pictionary until 11:30 at night and had a blast.  My team won, with the other group coming up fast behind us.  We kept rolling 2's and 3's while they'd get 4's and 5's, but justice prevailed :) and the smart folks won.  Each team had a Burmese guy on it, so we had a few \"new card\" incidents with that.  Some of those phrases, well, they're not familiar.  But we only had that happen about three times during the entire game.  Booze, drawing, and shouting make for a happy crowd."
"nothing is more obnoxious than two women that are absolutely eccentric with their TiVo replays watching the Golden Globes together via phone, 750 miles apart.

"urlLink Tyler Cowen  weighs in on  urlLink Jacob Levy's  proposal to vote libertarian. I take issue with his first point in his analysis.   1. Your vote will not count, no matter what. If the election is close, the courts will decide it. \"They\" won't let me (or Jacob) decide an election.  2. The most important effect of your vote is on yourself. Over time people come to identify with their previous political commitments. \"Digging in\" is a much more frequent phenomenon than is \"conversion.\" If you vote libertarian [fill in another other party name here], you will likely become more libertarian over time.  3. So ask yourself whether you wish to become, both publicly and privately, more toward the mainstream or more toward your potential third party vote. Make your decision accordingly.   Only because there is already one instance where point number one does not apply: the 2000 election.  The electors were already certified, and would have been certified by Florida legislature, regardless. The SCOTUS intervened to stop the bleeding, not decide the election. If the Court had stayed out (which would have been the preferable option), the House would get to decide whether to accept the Bush electors.   So, in effect, if you lived anywhere else in the country, you would have gotten two votes. One for president, and one for your congressman who would have decided the election. If you lived in Florida, you got up to three votes. One for president, one for your congressman who would have decided the election, and one for your state legislator who voted to certify the electors.  The second two points are completely valid, but the natural scenario is no court involvement whatsoever, even in a close race for president. Of course, races for lesser offices are entirely different, and point one might well apply."
"Took an easy day of driving around, checked out Wailua waterfalls, Kipu waterfalls, and then hung out on Lydgate beach the rest of the day."
"I've been waking up a very tired little boy lately. On sunday I stayed up until 1 o clock playing Shenmue II, getting about halfway through(i'm hopelessly addicted to this game). I think it was well worth it, even if I did wake up in the morning feeling like a lethargic lunatic. Last night was the same story, only a little worse. I got my new EGM magazine yesterday, and I read the whole thing, every word, in one day. It probably wasn't the smartest thing to do, considering that it kept me up until a little after 3 in the morning, but I simply couldn't put it down. At the end of the 10 hour (give or take a few) reading fest I still felt enthralled and I desperately wanted to read something else, or write a story, or play a game, but I was too damn tired to do anything of the sort. This morning I felt the worst I have felt in a long time after awakening from my slumber. In my early morning blur of exhaustion I denounced school and even called it  The Neverending Assault On The Well Being Of Millions Of Teenagers Across America  and  The Sleeping Man's Bane . I came up with vaguely philosophical questions and statements like \"What the hell is school's problem, waking me up at 6:30 in the [fucking!] morning? If any person ever tried to wake me up at this time I would be like 'Hey asshole, turn off the light, i'm going back to sleep!' But school gets away with it every single day, now what is up with that?\" Shortly afterwards my mom broke in with \"Get up and get ready, it's 8:05 already\", squandering my hopes of staying home from school. Although I had no specific reason of staying home, besides being tired, I was sorely dissapointed. It turned out for the better though, because now I am feeling wide awake, and I even had fun in 1st block. The old saying goes \"mama knows best\", and today, that saying was true.  We had to read our fellow classmates' essays in English today as a \"peer review\". Soon after doing this I realized that there is no end to human stupidity. Some of the shit(literally) that I read was so unbelievably idiotic that you would have to read it to believe it. It was insane! I don't understand how a person could be that dumb. It sounded like something a kindergartener would write. I have one question to ask Cliff Mitchell(the kid who not only wrote the worst essay I have ever read in my life but also the craziest looking motherfucker this side of the Mississippi). Where the hell were you the last nine years of English class!?!?  Much more is on the mind of brilliance that is my own, but I must go, for the bell has rung, signaling the end of class."

"Ok, so I haven't posted in a while. It's been busy around the office and I'm paranoid about getting fired for spending WAYYY to much time online.....It's jsut that getting fired is NOT on my list of things to do this semester.

"Chris gave me a topic to write about. I do not remember how he phrased it, but the gist of it was to name the 5 albums that describe me/my life the best. At least I think that was what he asked, if it wasn't I have no doubt that he will correct me :)  Here it goes...(in no particular order)...   1.  \"Surfacing\"  Sarah McLachlan-  Sarah writes and sings her songs about the worry and care that she has for other people. I can relate to her helping hand, her consideration, and her pity.   2.  \"When the Pawn\"  Fiona Apple-  Fiona also writes about her feelings for other people, the men in her life to be more specific. I can see myself saying many of her lyrics to the men in my life. And dammit do they deserve it.   3.  \"Tails\"  Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories-  I love listening to Lisa and her lyrics. They are fun, child-like, and at times far fetched. I can lose myself in her music and her lyrics. Her songs bring me back to the time where I embarked in my theatre aspirations. I remember listening to her in the car too and from rehearsals, singing at the top of my lungs.    4.  \"August & Everything After\"  Counting Crows-  Jonathan Vaughan, one of the first loves of my life, introduced me to the Counting Crows my Junior year in high school. He had just moved out from Texas and was in my drama class. We clicked immediately. To this day he is still one of my bestest buds. One of the few friends that you know where ever you end up, you will always have their telephone number. Jon and I used to sing these songs together...He on his guitar while I created harmony lines in my head...I miss him. This is our album.   5.  \"We Can't Dance\"  Genesis-  First of all, Phil Collins is wonderful. Second of all, this album reminds me of my family and our funny side, as well as the serious moments that we share. And there is a song about crashing cars...Why I relate to that I have no idea."
"You know, I just realized something. I always worried about how people probably think I'm weird because I go to the park and swing on the swings and listen to my music when I need to think. Well, I don't care. Everyone has a place that they think in, and that just happens to be mine. I don't even know why. It just relaxes me. It helps me filter my thoughts. I think way too much for my own good, and I just...can't think in my house. It's not that my family doesn't give me privacy. They certainly do, but...still. It's just where I go, and I like it, so I don't care if people think I'm weird."
"Sorry, guys haven't posted here in a while.  I've worked 7 of the last 8 days, and along with my commitments to movie-vault.com I haven't had a chance to get on here and talk about whats going on.   So, I'm up to three reviews, soon to be five, at the site.  I'm liking the gig, and I have my first theatrical release coming up, where I'll be reviewing \"The Ladykillers\" starring Tom Hanks.  Am I the only one who thinks this movie is gonna be any good?  What is that?  Good to see that we're in 76th place now for anyone who needs to see the most on brett card favre master.  How that makes sense, I don't know, but Brokun Minds is #1 on google if you search for coastal slazer.  Yeah, we should do a horror/comedy... something with a viable plot... we don't need a working screenplay, but even just a plot would be nice.  I think the lines could be ad libbed, much like \"Something about Nothing\", the Grade 9 masterpiece which, quite believably, had me, you, Francois Bletiere and Dustin Webb as the most feared Street Gang this side of The Warriors or The Outsiders.  Hey, Wes, the city offers up screenwriting classes.  I want to go, but like a chick going to the can, I don't wanna go alone.  Let's do this!  At the very least, it gives us shit to do, and at least when we write in screenplay format, we'll understand what the Hell we're trying to get across."

"...Sadly, there is not much to post  Friday: Attend the \"Badin Breakdown\"--A kareoke contest held on South Quad that included, among other things, a group of guys dressed like cowboys yowling to \"Living on a Prayer.\"  In the words of one of the judges, \"Thanks...I actually  used to like that song.  Now?  I'm not so sure.\"   Friday Night: Play cards with a friend.  And eat Nutella.  Yep, another exciting night in the Bland. Saturday: Wake up at 715am for some still unknown reason.  Decide to go study.  Go to Panera and write from 830 to almost noon.  Decide need fun new spring purse.  Purchase said purse.  Temperature drops by 30 degrees.  Bloody weather. Saturday Night: See The Prince and Me which was, by far, the worst movie I have paid 6 bucks to see in the past year.  It's so sad...Julia Stiles has actual  talent .  Why does she insist on being in stupid teeny bopper movies?  Why is it so bad?  Because they couldn't put the plot together with crazy glue.  And the dialogue is stilted.  Not to mention that it's nowhere close to believable.  I mean, I feel that it is more likely I could run into the talking trees in Return of the King than to have a conversation/situation like that which occured in this movie.

Hopefully my sister will come home soon with the car and then at least I can drive around and be bored.  My life is so exciting.  I'm probably making you dumber by the moment, I'm sorry.

"small-town pennsylvania fun    favorite part of the weekend #1:  when miss u., my still-on-the-prowl middle-school librarian, plopped down on the bar stool next to the boy and asked who he was and what he did for a living, and he answered, \"i'm an exotic dancer at paradise palms. i'm just passing through.\"   favorite part of the weekend #2:  when joey k., the boy i used to chase around the playground in second grade, saw the boy and i walking down main street, and started telling the boy all about how i used to chase him around the playground in second grade.   favorite part of the weekend #3:  when, at breakfast, i sarcastically told my mother her hair looked  \"awesome\"  and she replied \"shut. up.\"   most disturbing part of the weekend for anyone other than jg ballard:  when, on late friday night in dense fog on a mountaintop somewhere, we were among the first cars upon a scene of an accident in which a car had flipped over onto its roof and a bloodied woman sat propping herself up in the middle of the highway, wailing in agony.   least favorite parts of the weekend #1-#14:  all the times my mother mentioned someone i graduated high school with who was either planning a wedding, happily married, or expecting a child."

"Metro.  Middle of the night.  Somewhere on Mars.  Rolling Fields          It's a gorgeous sight, even in the dark of night, the brilliant yellows and greens of tall grasses waving in the chill wind, rolling hills stretching off as far as the eye can see. Pure, white stars shine in the breaks of the thick, dark cloud cover above, bringing a mild, yet still chilled, warmth to the vast expanse of land.         As you reach the peak of one of the highest hills, you are able to survey the land as the scent of life washes over you. Almost ninety degrees from the hill with the huge, gaping hole, and far off into the distance there is a massive forest, several deer darting into the trees as you spot it, as if sensing your discerning eye. Immediately opposite it is a large body of water, from which the cave stream flows. Ninety degrees from it, directly opposite the cavern entrance, there rests Novus Valnastium, a large stone complex resting atop another hill, one lone tower stretching into the sky above.         A little off to the northeast (assuming Novus is north), a small, metallic-bowl structure sits. Long tethers sometimes stretch into the sky from beyond it, connecting to a marvelous airship docked above the bowl. The slender curves and high-tech metals used on the small building are a stark contrast to the ruins just fifty yards away, and it easily gives away who is responsible for such a building.                                  >                                  Contents: Standingwater Obvious exits: Novus Valnastium    The Living Forest    Clear Lake    Hole in the Hill    High-Tech Workshop      Standingwater is seated before a fire at the usual gathering spot. He looks... irritated. Nothing new about that.  Keene takes his time moving out of the tunnel, muttering to himself about `a decent set of stairs, you fucking savages'. He has managed to avoid getting his shoes wet, though. Gradually, he makes his way down to said spot, standing for a few seconds in silence before speaking. \"Hello.\"  Standingwater loses some of his irritabilty as he looks up from poking at the fire with a stick. Fuckin' savage. \"Ah. Mr. Keene. Good to see you. Pull up a rock. Get comfortable. There is a job that needs doing, and the Invisible College seem to be the ones to do it.\"  Alex wanders out of Novus Valnastium in the distance, slowly closing ground until he has arrived in the heart of the fields. Alex has arrived. Alex steps out of the keep and head in the direction of the cavern.  Keene, invited for once, moves over and finds a relatively flat rock to sit on, easing onto it carefully. It's disingenuous to see a man in a suit and Standingwater sitting near each other around a campfire, but so is most of the Realm. \"Alright,\" he says.  Standingwater tosses a bit more wood onto the fire. \"We've had our differences over methods. But one thing I do like about you guys is your willingness to actually get out and do something. I'm a bit of an activist myself. My early years were spent in ecoterrosim before the Verbena came calling.\"  Keene slides a cigarette out of his breast pocket, waves it in the fire for a second, then brings it back and takes a mild puff. He listens.  'Ecoterrorism' catches Alex's ear as he nears the campfire. His head turns a little in the direction of the two men, probably a side ways glance in their direction from behind the shades.  Standingwater pulls his hat down over his eyes as he speaks. \"We have a problem. Unfortuantly, working within the system isn't working. We need something radical. Is there something you guys can do to make the Hyperion site unsuitable for building? Say, a huge sinkhole? Generally unstable ground? Perhaps a radon problem.\"  Alex perks an eyebrow at Standingwater's request. \"That sounds like acts of terrorism,\" he comments, not really seeming to personally find any problem with it,\"People jumped all over me whenever I talked about doing such thing....\"  Keene sits silently, having no immediate reaction to Standingwater's proposal. He puffs on his cigarette, gaze tracking to Alex for a few seconds before looking back to the native. \"Let's assume for a moment,\" says Keene, \"that such a thing was even feasible in this heavily urbanized area. What purpose would it serve?\"  Standingwater shrugs. \"It does sound like terrorism, yes. I'm only opposed to reckless terrorism. Materials and equipment should be the primary target. Attempt to minimize harm to bystanders. Sometimes lumberjacks get hurt when they cut into a spiked tree.\" His attention is drawn back to Keene. \"At the very least, it would delay construction long enough for the legal process to go through. We must thwart the Ironteeth in their attempts to build a new base of operations. \"  \"I have already start working on getting a cease and desist order to stop construction until the issues that have been raised can be resolved,\"Alex comments.

"You've probably seen this joke before, I've seen it many times on the internet, and I may have even posted it once before, but I don't think I did.  But I love this joke, so here it is anyway:  On a chain of beautiful deserted islands in the middle of nowhere, the following people are stranded:  - Two Italian men and one Italian woman  - Two French men and one French woman  - Two German men and one German woman  - Two Greek men and one Greek woman  - Two English men and one English woman  - Two Bulgarian men and one Bulgarian woman  - Two Japanese men and one Japanese woman  - Two Chinese men and one Chinese woman  - Two Irish men and one Irish woman  - Two American men and one American woman   One month later, on these absolutely stunning deserted islands in the middle of nowhere, the following things have occurred:  * One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman.  * The two French men and the French woman are living happily together in a mnage a trois.  * The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of alternating visits with the German woman.  * The two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them.  * The two English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the English woman.  * The two Bulgarian men took one look at the Bulgarian woman and started swimming to another island.  * The two Japanese have faxed Tokyo and are awaiting instructions.  * The two Chinese men have set up a pharmacy/liquor store/restaurant/laundry, and have gotten the woman pregnant in order to supply employees for their store.  * The two Irish men divided the island into North and South and set up a distillery. They do not remember if sex is in the picture because it gets somewhat foggy after a few liters of coconut whiskey. However, they're satisfied because the English aren't having any fun.  * The two American men are contemplating suicide, because the American  woman will not shut up and complains relentlessly about her body, the true nature of feminism, what the sun is doing to her skin, how she can do anything they can do, the necessity of fulfillment, the equal division of household chores, how sand and palm trees make her look fat, how her last boyfriend respected  her opinion and treated her nicer than they do, and how her relationship with her mother is the root cause of all her problems, and why didn't they bring a damn cell phone so they could call 911 and get them all rescued off this God- forsaken deserted island in the middle of freaking nowhere so she can get her nails done and go shopping."

"I did something a little strange tonight. As I was driving home from my parents house, I used the seek function of my radio to tune it a a variety of stations. An interesting experience to say the least - a lot like evesdropping really. I had the sense that I was intruding on the lives of the people to whom these stations belong. Weather, news, sports - all local yet not Local. In my travels I found Missouri, Maine, Iowa, Michigan, New York. I tuned into one station that never identified itself - it seemed to be an evangelical broadcast - Listening further I noticed that it was a religious broadcast refuting modern miracles - the kind with no proof. Refuting them with scripture - citing passages that demonstrated how God's miracles were usually performed - in front of witnesses with verifiable facts usually with a message. A fascinating take on a subject usually clouded by charismatic charlatans and elaborate smoke and mirrors. Not at all what I expected."
"murder is too easy.   Damn, I was about to place a bet. In the case of my loosing, I would have to kiss the first female person who would come into the lab.

It's over.       Sad song.  Depression to realizing things are not so bad. 07   Lashing Out       Lyric:  Smile and sing along to every single song       Singing along to some band at a show. 08   Police Police Me       Lyric:  The stars are all smiling.  It's disarming.       Media, cops, and criminals are all the same. 09   Oh Penny       Lyric:  And my dear old sharona keeps em on the floor wanting more       Happiness with someone elsewhere, but Penny is here now. 10   The Switch       Lyric:  I'm a nervous wreck. Hey I'm a tightrope.       Sex compared to a video game?  Huh?  High score...if it takes all night. 11   Absolute Zero Drive       Lyric:  So wake up soldiers and take all your arms and leave       My favorite song.  No fear, man. 12   Go On Drone       Lyric:  Stop the press. Who is that mess?       Miserable person continues to mope."
"Another semi-obscure Family Guy referrence.  Before sleep gets the best of me, I feel complelled to finish the story of the story I wrote, in the week of the last.     I thought it wasn't too good at the time, and when I got it back in class today, there were no positive comments on it, and not really any negative comments either.   Suggestions of cutting it down in scope and introducing the first person narrator sooner.  Solid possibilities I just feel so frustrated.  When I write a story, I've conceptualized it for over two weeks off and on, and I think that things are set.  To go back and rework is a pain because it goes against what I've already built up.  Perhaps I'll post parts of it as is.  But most likely not.  I keep saying and thinking I've got a great story inside, but it never comes out and I guess that means I talk a lot of shit, without knowing it."

"Hey guys! Hope you're all doing great! I celebrated my 21st birthday on Monday and got drunk off my ass! LOL It's the first time I've ever drank that much. Luckily I still remember everything, so that's always good LOL! And I had some VERY bizarre dreams that night.... talking animals telling me they don't like me because they think I'm \"shifty\" LMAO, snakes and ostriches (sp?) chasing me, and men speaking to me in spanish... see told you they were ODD.  I have come to the decision that I absolutely HATE cars! My POS broke down a while back and I had it fixed about a month ago, and then something else broke on it a couple weeks ago, and it had an oil leak (which luckily is covered under the inital warranty) then Monday I took the car in for an oil change and they said there was an engine oil leak so back to the shop it went. Now I gotta call and harass the mechanic... I swear if I have to take that car back there one more time for something petty like this I'm going to scream. *grrr*  Anyway, I hope you guys are doing good, I'll have to try and stop by this weekend and read the posts to catch up with you guys, but for now it's back to the daily grind."

"Just tragic   I've read all the Dostoevsky novels, those sad and dark tales where people die from chest colds and madness.  That was way back when people used coal for heat in their homes, and travelled by horse-drawn buggy.  This is 2002, almost 2003.  Things like that just don't happen anymore.  At least that's what I thought until now.    I received a phone call this morning on the way to work.  That was my first indication that something was wrong - my cell never rings in the morning.  It was my mother-in-law, who only calls in the morning  to be the first to wish her granddaughters a happy birthday.  Today was not a birthday.  Bad news was her reason for calling today.  As I listened, she explained that her brother called her today, first thing in the morning.  She had the same thought - he never calls that early in the morning, not even for birthdays.  Bad news was his reason for calling.  Their 20 year old daughter had caught a cold a few days ago, and was feeling having trouble breathing last night due to the congestion.  She went to sleep last night, woke up this morning unable to breath.  The ambulance was called and she was taken to the hospital, but sometime this morning she died.    Unbelievable, incredulous, impossible news.  I don't understand how this can happen.  I was dumbstruck and griefstricken all at the same time.  I wasn't very close to her, but she is my mother-in-law's niece, and very loved in our family.  This isn't some Dostoevsky novel, this is our life.  Death has touched our family and I don't know what to do about it.  I want to console my mother-in-law in her loss but I don't even know where to begin.  Before she hung up with me she asked me to take very good care of her girls (my daughters).  I told her of course I would.    I may have more thoughts on this later today, but I feel like just putting this into my blog may help relieve some of the sadness in my heart somehow.  And of course, as I always dwell on things in a philosophical manner, I am sure I will have more to say on this later.    Once the shock has worn off.  Diva out."

"Being tired like I am right now is normally enough to keep me from writing in my blogger.  When I am tired I write about things that are really bothering me... so here goes. In my last post if you couldn't tell the major themes are my own pride and my search for significance. As I stated I know beyond doubt that who I am is defined by the finished work of Christ. What I want to expose is where that line of thinking comes from. You see it seems like most everyone I know is finding there significant other to share in this life with. I am not jealous or angry in anyway, in fact I am joyed by this fact. This does leave a slight question mark on my own heart. I ask myself and God whether or not I am meant to have a wife? I try not to think of it, but in my mind it remains to be found out. Really, I have decided that if I am to be single I will do it for the glory of God, Iv'e decided that he is more than enough for me.        My selfishness and pride come into play is in questions like; am I good enough for a wife? Can I love as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her? In asking these questions I ask myself if I am really seeking God, truly seeking?! I do not want to be in a relationship and have doubts about whether or not I know what love is... I want true love to be an inherent part of my new nature. I want to give of who I am freely not worrying about the returns. I am scared that my love will hurt someone instead of heal. I have seen love used in this way my whole life, (not really love at all) from within my family, I am scared that in some way I might do the same. 1 John 4:18 says; There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.       My doubt, my fear, and anger will never accomplish the righteous life that God desires out of me. Corrie Ten Boom, the author of The Hiding Place when experiencing hardship in the Nazi concentration camps prayed to Jesus and asked for him to take away what she could not carry. For her, it was the anger she felt towards those who held her captive. In the end she realized that those who kept her captive where the real captives.They had on the \"man made manticles\" of sin which so easily ensnare us. If she did not forgive them she would never be free herself, but she gave this to God for it was to heavey for her. Years later she witnessed about God's love; not only to the former concentration camp inmates, but the guards as well. When I read that I realized that it is not giving up on my thoughts about marriage, and about my issue with pure love, it is giving them up to Christ that is important. If I start to sound like a broken record in the weeks and years to come it is becuase I am a slow learner. I will continuely be saying; \"Oh... Lord Jesus, you can carry this too?\" as I hand the fragments of my broken heart to my Lord who is able.        I have only had one girlfreind in my life, whom I truly loved, or thought that I did. I remember always being afraid of what books she was reading, and what classes she took in school. I never said any of this to her I didn't want to sound like a psycho. But there remained a part of me that was so afraid that if she spend her time reading secular books that her relationship with Christ would suffer. It only seemed natural that your whole focus should be for the glory of God and nothing else should matter. I realize that I am not perfect though, and in this realization understood that I was being controlling. I never acted on these thoughts of asking her not to be or do certain things at least I hope I didn't. The realization that I thought like my father in this area scared me enough to make me doubt whether I should ever attempt to be in a relationship. Again Lord, I ask you to take this fear from me also, I cast all my cares upon you Lord, this moment I lay all of these burdens down at your feet. Take from me all my unrighteousness and make me acceptable in your sight. I love you Jesus, and I thank you for all of your great and many mercies. Well enough out of me. If you read this please pray that the Lord supplies the strength I need to give all of these things to Him."

"It's been an eventful past couple days.   1. My sister \"graduated\" middle school on Friday. She's very happy about that. Now we'll both be at Raleigh Charter. Way less driving and way less hassle. We're both excited.   2. I've been  urlLink ROC-ified!  I got a job at my dad's office doing some research work, and Friday afternoon I went in for my orientation. Even though I'm really only doing temporary independent project-type work, they still had to put me through the whole orientation process that all employees do. Having never worked in an office before, I always thought the orientation scenes in movies were exaggerated. Now I know better. Take my word for it - it's  exactly  like the movies. There's a dark room with too many chairs for so few people; the walls are grey; there are no windows; and, of course, there are the stupid orientation films. I and the one other guy in there with me (he smoked like a fiend and I could smell him from across the room) had to watch two: one on blood transmuted pathogens, which didn't apply to either of us because we're not clinical workers, and one on office ergonomics. I'm not kidding. There was really a fifteen minute movie on how to sit properly and arrange your workstation to suit your needs. My mind was blown. We then had to go through all kinds of insurance things and sign lots of fun forms. Three hours later, I emerged with a name tag, a pamphlet with all the doctors' pictures and backgrounds (tee hee), and a freaking huge notebook with all kinds of procedures they expect me to read and become familiar with over the weekend. If my mind wasn't already made up before, I would now be convinced that a professorship has got to be better than an office job.   3. My sister and I took a beading class this morning at Ornamentea. We made  urlLink a nice double-stranded necklace  that, although it isn't the prettiest thing, taught us the basics of crimping and stringing. By the time the two of us got there all the pretty color kits had been taken (I really wanted the one with pink, white, and silver) so I got black and champagne, and my sister got white, teal, and black. At least we know how to do it now, and I am itching to go back, take some more classes, and learn how to make really cool stuff.   UPDATE: I added picture links to the above."

THAT'S SATAN THOUGHT! anywho, i might not be doing much of anything on my blog for a while. i'll try but i don't know. as if anyone care. not many people come here i don't think. if you do you never show it. but i'm a fine one to talk."
"It seems Iraq has their own Buford Pusser - Dr. Iyad Allawi. Don't let his dishdasha fool you, that's a pistol in his pocket and he's not afraid to use it! The new PM in Iraq is accused of meteing out some  urlLink tough justice  of his own on some suspected insurgents shortly before attaining his new position.   Iyad Allawi, the new Prime Minister of Iraq, pulled a pistol and executed as many as six suspected insurgents at a Baghdad police station, just days before Washington handed control of the country to his interim government, according to two people who allege they witnessed the killings.  They say the prisoners - handcuffed and blindfolded - were lined up against a wall in a courtyard adjacent to the maximum-security cell block in which they were held at the Al-Amariyah security centre, in the city's south-western suburbs.  They say Dr Allawi told onlookers the victims had each killed as many as 50 Iraqis and they \"deserved worse than death\"."
"Well Cameran just left, and I'm bored, so I think I'll catch up a little with my posting. Way back on Friday evening (the 18th), [little] Sam's family and Nadias family came over. 'Twas fun - we hung out and dled a ton of songs. Later, we took some random pictures and sent them to Cameran (who we were IMing).    On Saturday the 19th, around 3:00, we went to Davisons (a really good restaurant) and ate lunch, then went back to my Grandmothers house and had an Easter egg hunt and dessert. We left around 6:30 or 7:00, and [little] Sam came over to my house around 7:15. We messed around for a while, and then drove to Cams house where I was going to spend the night. Sam stayed at his house for around ten minutes until my dad left and took him home. Cam, his little bro. Caleb, and I ran around outside, built a six foot fire in his tiny grill, and jumped around on his trampoline from about 10:00 to 11:30. All this time, we were listening to various head-banger songs (Headstrong, Still Frame, Crawling in the Dark, and others) and talking on phones (me, on my cell, to Gwen, and Cam, on his house line, to Goody). We were trying to convince Goody to come over, but he was to tired and needed sleep before church, the next morning. Cam kept shining my spotlight at passing planes (he lives right by an airport), and we got kinda freaked out when two or three low-flying helicopters started circling the area with spotlights about ten minutes later. Goody (who lives about 8 blocks from Cam) was starting to get edgy too, but then quite suddenly, they just left. I was startled when, about five minutes later, Gwen heard and saw the same helicopters above her house (She lives 8 blocks from me; about 11.4 miles from Cams and Goodys houses) Later, we put the fire out by spraying it with a pressure-washer-velocity hose for 30 seconds, filling the air with little dust particles that got into my contacts, and steam, which cut down vision to about 5 feet. After making our way back to the door, we went inside, ate some really good brownies, and started playing HALO in Cams room. Cam was still talking to Goody, but Gwen had to get off for half an hour. When she called me back, we were still playing HALO, Goody had gotten off, and it was around 12:15. I think we finally stopped talking around 1:30, but beforehand, Cam decided it was to cold in his room. He has a rather interesting way of dealing with this: first he clears off his desk (as much as he can), then he pours about 4 ounces of rubbing alcohol onto it and LIGHTS IT (lol)  He let it burn for a while (prolly 45 seconds total), and believe me, the temperature in the room rose abut three degrees. When we finally decided to go to bed (about 2:15), it was too hot, so he grabbed a huge floor fan from the first floor, and left it running all night. We got into bed at 2:30, but talked for around 2 hours before finally falling asleep.  Sunday the 20th, we woke up at 8:22, 8 minutes before the Rivas were to come pick me up. We rushed to get ready, and actually were by 8:30, but Beth was 10 minutes late, so we didnt have to after all (lol). I didnt eat anything for breakfast except a huge matzah (spelling?) cracker, and nothing at all to drink until after first service. Then, I drank three glasses of tea, a couple of hot chocolate, and a ton of water (and ate several donuts). I found out that Brady lost his eyesight again right after he woke up that morning, but somehow was able to go get to church without his family noticing he showed amazing skill by walking around the fellowship hall, after everyone cleared out, bypassing every obstacle that was normally there, but tripping over things that werent (like feet and backpacks). Later, after second service, he suddenly got his sight back again.  I dont really know what to make of it all, but I do agree with Steven  if I were in his shoes, I wouldnt go walking around like that even if I could, because it just makes people suspicious. Youth church (during second service) was interesting  dont remember anything about it. (lol) After church was out, Goody, Steven, Peter, Brady, Pat and I went across the street to the Fred Meyer complex and found Cam. We hung around for a little while Steven bought more shoes, and Pat bought a huge sandwich (go figure  hes always hungry and hes nowhere near fat must have a really fast metabolism). We then headed back over to church, and Gwen called me. I got into the Gadaholts car, still talking, and we drove back over to Fred Meyer. I got off the phone when we got in, cause I knew we needed to be fast and it was going to take a while (I was exchanging a defective airsoft gun). Indeed I was right  they were really busy, and it took more than fifteen minutes. I called Gwen back once we got back in the car, but it was quite hard to hold a conversation cause of all the ambient noise in the car. Hahahaha *Remembering the Haggis song that Uncle Greg and Timy made up and kept singing*."

Honestly, I don't really care about the money that was in it for it was only P300.00 But in it were very important stuff, like my two ATMs (one of which is the ATM where I get my salary), the picture of my beloved god daughter, my prescription for my heart and blood, my medicard, my college ID, my Timezone card, and my Advantage card.  I got everything locked down and fixed.  I just have to get the cards as soon as possible.  Anyway, things turned out right in the end. =)  Well, that was the bad news.  The good news is, I had a first glimpse of what it would be like in front of the wheel.  For real this time and not the virtual racing games that I play in Timezone.  Honestly, it was really a good experience but I have learned that I still need a lot to learn.  It was really scary but this way, I am more determined to learn and really understand the importance of driving well and not just something that I would take for granted.  I see how hard it was to really drive with just that short span of time.  It was an experience I would never forget.  Anyway, I'm happy.  At the end of everything, I saw a bright light. =)"

"Thousands of pilgrims have been flocking to a public toilet in a remote French village, following reports that the face of Christ has miraculously appeared in the limescale in the bottom of one of its toilet bowls. \"It is true, the Saviour's face has appeared in the pan of the crapper in the left hand stall of the gents toilets - no matter how much toilet cleaner or bleach you put down there, or how hard you scrub, it always miraculously reappears once the toilet has been flushed,\" reveals Jacques Coullions, who has been the attendant at the Rennes-le-Chateau public lavatory for over thirty years.

In fact, I know of only one person who has been reading since day 1.  Well some people read day one and were turned off by it (me complaining about how html is hard) but eventually I got them to come back.   So I think this is cause for celebration!

WHICH hard-partying 'celebrity deejay' was recently bounced from L'Ermitage hotel and the Hyatt in L.A. while frittering away his share of the family fortune on drugs and booze?\"  The first one, I'll guess is  urlLink Hugh Jackman . I don't know why I say that, but it just seems right.  urlLink Gawker  agrees.  Choire Sicha  writes, \" Hugh Jackman , this one's easy; he's starring as a gay playboy in 'Boy from Oz' and he's the only one hot enough right now to be considered for James Bond... no,  John Stamos  in 'Nine' doesn't count...\"  The second blind item is  Cindy Crawford , The \"bars\" comment screams \"The Pulse\"  urlLink Rande Gerber , who owns bars and is a former model. Gawker agrees, \"Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber?\"    The last one is hard. Very hard. I'm guessing  Paul Sevigny , because, frankly, he and  Rosanna Arquette  are the only celebrity deejays I know about. But I'm pretty sure I am wrong on that. Gawker has a better guess. \"How about  Cameron Douglas , Michael's 23-year-old son-- maybe he's in need of a little attention?\""
"Sorry guys, news flash!! Apparently gay marriages are threatening the survival of the species. I wasn't previously aware that the human species was in direct danger of dying out, but our Prime Minister has assured me that we are, and that Gay marriages are to blame. This is an immense relief to myself as I'd been previously fretting that the world was becoming a mite overcrowded in places and that, possibly, billions of humans were using up natural resources quicker than they could replenish, destroying rainforests, creating deserts and causing the extinction of a multitude of other species. I was also a teensy bit concerned that the 6 billion humans crawling all over God's earth were creating quite a bit of pollution, destroying the ozone layer, melting the polar ice caps and polluting the oceans. Apparently I was foolish to be kept up all night because, contrary to my own misconceptions, humans are in serious danger of extinction themselves due to the mass pervadance (is that a word guy?) of gay marriages.  I guess I thought that it was possible that our own kind might one day go the way of the dodo, but I was convinced that it would more likely be caused by war (35 million dead since WWII, 90% civilians), disease (50,000 in Rwanda alone since the crisis in the 80's) or an asteroid about to collide with the earth where our only hope of survival is to send an off-shore drilling team into the asteroid to plant a nuclear bomb blowing it smithereens, only complicated by the fact that the mission leaders daughter is in love with one of the crew members and is torn between loyalties in a touching story about good, evil, human endeavour, asteroids, the breeding abilities of starbucks stores and how it all is somehow tied to the collapse of the asian economy... sorry did I get sidetracked?  Anyways I guess I thought you should all know that you can sleep well at nights knowing that the ills of the world and mankind's possible failure to exist are the lone fault of a small minority of the poulation - homosexuals, who, now thanks to prime ministerial decree, you can safely pillorise, demonize, antagonize and generally discriminate against at will. Isn't that great?"

"I spent the day in Macon with my boyfriend yesterday. We had a really good time just hanging out and talking and laughing. I really love him.   All of my friends are out of town and today I was kind of bored, so I decided to go to the movies. I saw  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen . It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. On Friday, I saw  28 Days Later . It was ok, but not great. It wasn't really all that scary; you didn't feel any real threat from the zombies. It started out kind of interesting, but then just got stupid at the point they got to the blockade."
"Guess who's going to see Pulp Fiction tomorrow?  Me!  Not a big deal except I'm seeing it in a theater!!!!!  Kent State University's theater is showing Pulp Fiction tonight and tomorrow night at midnight.  It means I'll be watching Pulp Fiction until almost 3AM, but dammit that rocks!!!!  Worked tonight until almost 9PM.  I guess it's a good thing no one wanted to go out tonight since I was at work so late.  Oh well, I'll go out next Friday.  I get paid next Friday anyway, so that works.  That's pretty much it.  I worked tonight and that's it.  I'm off to watch Hollywood Babylon on VH1.  That is all."
"urlLink Fostering Information Literacy  : Yet another recent find of a good information literacy book.  Here is a review of the book from  School Library Journal :  The authors' purpose is to offer library media specialists strategies \"-to convince teachers that information literacy is not `something extra' to be taught in addition to their normal curriculum but is an attitude, a process-that can be introduced and encouraged while subject matter is being learned.\" A meshing of information-literacy standards with content-area standards, model lesson plans and reproducible transparencies, and exceptional annotated source notes and additional reading lists provide the necessary help for initiating staff development. Administrators who provide materials and personnel that allow for flexible scheduling, and library media specialists who act as instructional leaders and agents of change are identified as essential elements. Although evaluation modes are underscored, the one missing element is a clear-cut, strong statement regarding the administrators' need to evaluate classroom teachers regarding their effective use of and collaboration with the total library media program. LMSs can only offer services and assistance. It is this evaluation process that is a key component to success. Still, this book is to the point and useful.-M. Ellen Jay, Damascus Elementary School, MD   I think the review is a bit harsh at the end but I am also not a school librarian so I won't judge the validity of the review.  I think this book is worth looking at by librarians at many levels.  The ideas in the book may be written for school librarians but much of the content can be translated for other settings."
"Sucky Sunday   Saturday really sucked, but unfortunately for me, the suckiness carried into Sunday as well. I was in bed by 4am Sunday morning, but by 10:30am, I still hadn't slept at all. I stayed in bed until 3:30pm, until I couldn't stand it any longer. I don't think I slept more than an hour or so.   I tossed and turned pretty much the whole time, played guitar awhile too, trying to tire myself out, but I wound up working on an old tune of mine. I just could not get comfortable. On top of that, I started thinking of stupid stuff (like winning the lottery) and my mind took off with it, figuring out what I'd do, how I'd do it... stupid stuff. I guess you could say I was daydreaming, because I certainly wasn't dreaming for real. I wasn't asleep, I was well aware of that.   I don't get it though. I mean, at some point, isn't the concious mind supposed to shut down and let the unconscious mind take over? I used to be normal in that way, but I'm not anymore. My mind just isn't working right.   Oh yeah, before I went to bed last night, I went over JP's setlists (he sent everyone in the band new setlists) and I made a bunch of changes to them, trying to get a better flow, and I emailed them out to the guys. It turns out JP and Al liked what I'd done (no word from Jimmy), so we'll be using them tomorrow. Al made a good change on the setlist as well. We're starting to communicate a lot better, so that's good. We jam tomorrow (later tonight, actually).  I spent the rest of the day pulling cards, installing stuff back onto my PC, scanning cards, listing cards for sale, and then sending out winner's notices.   My Mom was killing me all day with that stupid Ice Skating crap on TV all afternoon. Ugh! I hate the music, I hate the performances, I hate the commentators, I just hate everything about it.   And \"sport\" my ass.    Luckily she went back to her room while I was listing. I turned everything off and focused on listing my cards. I do my listings better in silence, with no distractions.   It's nearly 1am now. There's a couple of movies coming on that I want to see (\"Dead Man\" and \"Road To Perdition\"), but I think I might just go on to bed instead."
"Hello Ladies!!  I'm finally getting around to posting for the first  time in over two days.  I have to catch up on all the posts.  I've just had a lot of school work and stuff.  I'm so mad right now.  I went to put a battery in my camera (the new one I got in July) and the door on the battery compartment is broken.  I'm so upset, I know Kodak is going to tell me it is not covered under warranty.  I was able to put tape on it to at least transfer my pictures to the computer.  I'm gonig to call them as soon as I get off.    Well all my days are running together.  I know I saw a lot of Adam today with all the stuff going on in California (Nat and Nan - what do you think of that ruling??)  I think I saw Rick this morning and just saw Greg.  I missed Todd on The Fox Report last night but did see Rick's reporting on the womem's prison.    We are are waiting here on the east coast to see what this hurricane is going to do.  I'm like 3 hours from the ocean so we will get mostly the winds and rain but won't get the powerful impact like the coast.  The rain sucks though because hubby and I are going to Niagara Falls this weekend and it will probably rain the whole time.    Jayel - I was cracking up when Shep was talking about that town in OK changing its name to Viagara.  Nat - I knew you would be hot about the recall.   I was just reading the article you posted.  It sounds like the Supreme Court will probably take the case and let the recall go on.  Don't know if it would still be the 7th or not.  Keep those absentee ballots you may need them.   I don't even live there and this stuff drives me crazy.    LOL!!  No Hottie Toddie shaved.  How did it look.  I really like the goatee.  Nan - I love Red Lobster.  I'm with Nat - I love those rolls they give you.  Yeah I couldn't sleep and I woke up on Saturday morning and there was Rick.  I couldn't believe I was up that early.    Well gotta go.

"i've decicded to try the south beach diet and blog about both my humiliating experiences and my horrible failures. today is my first day on the diet. it's 3:00 and i already am not too much of a fan. on the other hand, since i don't eat any meats beside chicken and turkey, it won't be too much of a setback. being italian, though, i eat everything with bread. being from philly, i have french fries and ketchup with every meal that isn't pasta. but, sometimes, i'll eat fries with pasta too. yesterday, i decided that today would be my first day on the diet. so, carrie and i went out to dinner and i had my favorite huge meal: a double turkey burger and fries from the city grille. this morning, i woke up and realized that i have little-to-no idea about how to actually be on this diet. carrie was filling me in on the blanks since she did it and lost weight on it. i remembered three things: 1. no carbs. 2. lots of chicken. 3. lots of peanuts. for breakfast, i had 2 heaping handfuls of cashews. they were laura's cashews. so, i should probably buy some to replace the ones i ate. for lunch, i had half of a chicken breast, cooked in balsamic vinegar and served over a bowl of lettuce with, guess what, balsamic vinegar. i'm drinking lots of water because the vinegar has made me feel lightheaded. for dinner, i'll probably have scrambled eggs. i like doing things backwards. the only thing is, i don't know how to figure out if i've lost weight or not. our scale sucks. on any given day, it'll tell me i'm anywhere between 150 and 260 lbs. my weight fluctuates quickly but not that quickly."

"An article about Curb Your Enthusiasm's  urlLink Larry David  in the New Yorker.  Interesting article, about his failed stand-up comic beginnings, and a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff about how an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm is conceived and filmed.  (Thanks to  urlLink Howard Bashman  for the link.)  In all honesty: I'm not a huge \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" fan.  I can appreciate that it's funny, I can recognize that Larry David is very talented, and very gifted at what he does, and when I watch an episode, I will usually laugh.  But I find the show unsatisfying.  I don't seek it out, I don't \"like\" to watch it.  I think it's a idiosyncratic preference I find I have for television shows and movies where I like the characters.  I like them to be funny, I like them to be entertaining -- but I also like to like them as people, I like to be able to identify with them, to understand them, to root for them.  And the problem I have with Curb Your Enthusiasm -- and that I had with Seinfeld, and Cheers, and that I have with Frasier, for example, is that I don't like any of the characters, I don't identify with them, I don't want to know them, want to watch their lives unfold, want to see them escape from sitcom situations.  When I was a kid, I liked \"Doogie Howser,\" I liked \"The Wonder Years,\" I liked the dorky math show on public television, \"Square One\" with the \"MathNet\" detective bits (which might not be a good illustration of the point I'm making, but good lists always come in threes).  Characters that were, on their own, without the weekly plots and stories, enjoyable to watch, characters I could identify with, and could root for.  I feel like that happens to me when I watch movies too.  I thought \"Finding Forrester\" was great.  No one else did.  I liked \"Bubble Boy.\"  Really no one else did.  At all.  But in \"Bubble Boy,\" the title character had an innocence, a naivete, a vulnerability -- I felt for him, I wanted good things to happen.  I watch a movie like \"American Beauty,\" which everyone besides me thought was amazing, and I don't like any of the characters, I don't like the world they live in, and I just don't enjoy the movie.  I can't sit through the Lord of the Rings movies, the Matrix movies, anything science-fiction really, because I just can't get caught up in what's going on, I don't care about the world they're in.  All this is just to say the Larry David article is interesting, even if you're not a huge fan of his show.  And also I wrote all this because I felt like sharing.  :)"

(best friends over boyfriends- we're gonna pwn j00 Josh!!)  So, yell at me if you want to, but that's the situation.  Just thought you might like to know.

"Random Rants  By Duf \"New and Improved with Extra Links\" Fer  1.  I feel sorry for  urlLink Ralph Nader .  He's going to get creamed, and he is going to look like a traitor in the process.  As a (Big D) Democrat, I have to tell you, the one thing we Dems need this electoral season is unity.  We have to be singular in our focus, and any divisiveness is against the plan.  Our friends across the aisle have done a masterful job of keeping their team together behind one goal (even though there are two very different types of conservatives (social conservatives versus fiscal conservatives) they stay together.  Fight and make deals behind the scenes, but in public, have one party, one platform, one message).  We need to match that togetherness.  My main man Nader is tearing that down.  Ralph is running without a party affiliation.  He had no chance of winning in 2000, and he has even less of a chance now.  I really want to see his issues highlighted (especially universal health care and 100% publicly financed elections), but running for President when you have ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE OF WINNING is not the way to do it.  It comes off as an exercise in ego.  Personally, I don't think even Ralph can derail the donkey this November, but why try.  Why run the risk of having as part of your resume \"delivered 8 years of Bush\"?  So I feel sorry for Ralph and fear that all he is going to do is end up tarnishing the memory of a man whose legacy should be safer cars, OSHA and the EPA.  2.  I saw  urlLink Frank Vascellaro  and  urlLink Amelia Santaniello  at Target in Edina.  I didn't speak.  3.  If you live in MN and you have any free time at all, I beg you:  run (don't walk) run to see  urlLink Hairspray .  I saw it yesterday afternoon, and it is wonderful.  It is racy (double entendre - pun intended), but the cast has so much fun, and the fun is so contagious that you can't help but have a blast.  Also, the music is great.  I must confess, that as one of a very, very, very few African-Americans in the audience, I found it ironic that this play talking about integration in the 60s has not yielded perhaps as much progress as we sometimes think we've made.  For obvious reasons, I know very few people who choose not to spend time with others based on race, but, for some reason, you don't see many events or communities that are truly integrated.  It really stood out at the show.  4.   urlLink Vacation on Friday .  Can't wait.  5.  What ever you do, no matter how desperate you get to save money on goods you buy every day.  I urge you to stay away from  urlLink this site .  I have become a total junkie, and I would hate to see it happen to you."

"Guitar Shop   Feeling inspired tonight, I took my guitar apart and cleaned all of the metal hardware (except the machine heads), the pickups, I fixed my volume/tone control knobs (I had been missing a knob and a screw for ages), and put brand new strings on. It looks nicer than it's looked in a long, long time, but my fingers are still burning from the damned Naval Jelly! I guess I should have worn gloves like the label said. Oh well.  The next job with the guitar will be to re-set the intonation, which is a big pain in the ass. I may re-adjust the action first though, another pain in the ass job, if I'm feeling adventurous enough. We shall see...  I talked to my friend John tonight and he offered me his Fostex 4-track recorder for $200, which is a fair enough price (I looked on the internet and found used ones for as low as $97), but he's really doing me a huge favor by letting me pay it off $40 a month, which is only $20 per paycheck! How cool is that? He said he'll bring it over next Thursday, when we're supposed to rehearse again. I can't wait! This will be an enormous help to me in composing my songs. I have had a 4-track of my own for years, but it doesn't work anymore, hasn't for years, and I don't know if it's something internal or if it's the adapter. I pawned it once and the stupid ass pawn shop sold it to someone while I was still making payments on it. I made them get it back from the guy they sold it to, and ever since then, it hasn't worked worth shit. I think either the shop or the customer (who was none too happy about having to return his purchase) sabotaged it in some way, because it ran beautifully before I pawned it. I really can't wait to have a working one again! Woo-hoo!"
"Hey LevenGals!  Had a good (but busy) weekend.  Friday night, movie with Logan.  Up early Saturday, tons of errands, shopping, etc.  Saturday night, Fresno State football game with Brendon.  Sat in the student section.  A little disappointed in their trash talking.  Only two words they seemed to know were bulls*** (directed at the refs) and (fill in name of opposing team member) sucks.  I expected better, they are after all, college students.  Driving home (after midnight) remembered it was my turn to prepare a meal for a family in my Sunday school class.  So up real early Sunday morning for a quick run to the grocery store to hit the deli for some enchiladas and then got the rest of the fixings. Back home, opened the back of my car and the gallon of milk I had just bought falls out and busts wide open on the driveway.  Washed the milk away (no sense crying) and put the meal together and managed to get to church only 10 minutes late.  Thought for a moment I might just drop off the meal and then go home, but reconsidered as my day wasn't starting out too well and figured I could use all the help I could get.  Day improved as it went along, my Texans and Broncos won and I even got the house clean and laundry done before the sun went down.  Now if my asthma would slow down and let me catch my breath, things would be hunky dory. LOL  No time for hottie watching, but from the looks of things I haven't missed much.    Teri  - I have it on high authority that Arianna Huffington and Peter Camejo are from Uranus.  They flew here to planet Earth on a space ship that landed in the middle of the California desert.  But not to worry, Arianna and Pete aren't responsible for the air pollution from their emission spewing space craft because it was coming here anyway.      Nat  - Did you catch the town hall meeting Arnold did with Sean Hannity on Thursday?  It was broadcast on Sean's radio show.  Parts of it were also shown on Studio B and then more of it on Hannity & Colmes.  Arnold managed to impress me as a candidate.  Sean asked him tough and very specific questions and he answered every one straight on and didn't resort to candidate-speak once.  He won me and my vote.  I still like McClintock, but I think he will have too much resistance from the legislature to be very effective.  Arnold will have the ability to go over them and straight to the \"people\" and put pressure on those in Sacramento to achieve the budgetary cuts that are necessary in the same way Reagan did when he was Governor.  Hey, I'm taller than somebody! (I'm 5'3\")  My boys are always making fun of me and calling me \"mini me\". LOL     Jayel  - No, no other Fox News list is as good as this one.  Jeff definitely has pretty brown eyes.  I like his smile too.  Haven't seen the new Fox Report promo, but will be on the lookout for it.     Jan  - A pop-up tent, that is so great.  I've always wanted one of those.  Hubby and I (and the dog) like camping too.  We don't do too much of it, as he camps out most of the summer when he's at fires and doesn't really feel like it when he's on vacation.  Can't imagine why. LOL  I joined Curves about a year ago, and I love it.  It's the first workout program I've ever stuck with for a long period of time.  Hubby can't understand why I don't want to workout at a  gym filled with buffed smelly men.  Thanks, but no thanks.  Besides, I get my allotment of eye candy by watching Fox. LOL   Sherry  - 60 lbs - wow!  I've lost 30 lbs in the last year just by working out at Curves (and cutting down on the carbs).  I'm now going to start following the Curves diet plan.  Hopefully I'll have more luck and finally get down to my desired weight.  Not quite half way there, but at least I've made some progress.  Keep us updated on how you're doing on Weight Watchers.    Hope this week is better for hottie viewing.  Talk to you later!"
"So Halloween was fun.  It started first thing in the morning when I put on my sexy new cowboy hat and tottered off to work in my seldom-worn boots with my little pan of brownies decorated to look like a graveyard.  Our office Halloween party started around 1:00 and included a good five hours of eating, drinking and -- yes -- karaoke.  (You haven't lived as a homosexual until you've belted \"Stand By Your Man\" in a cowboy outfit in front of a conference room packed with inebriated co-workers.)  After work, Dan, Nick, Phil (as Wolverine -- the only other one of us not too chicken to dress up) and I met up for pizza and headed to Boystown to watch the parade.  Unfortunately (fortunately?) the crowd was too thick to see anything so we headed into Sidetrack where it was warmer -- and there was a constant loop of gay boys parading around the bar in their Halloween finery.  While we were standing around gawking, I managed to start talking with Neil, a guy I've been wanting to meet for a good three years.  Fresh out of a relationship, he was amicable and chatty enough that I thought we'd get to know each other  a lot more  before sunrise.  He even volunteered that he was going commando -- a fact I assume is usually mentioned only in the context of a gay seduction.  Turns out, though, that he was only making conversation.     Sigh.     But after three otherwise wasted hours, he did give me a ride home. :)"

(IT WAS AN OMEN-I SHOULD HAVE GONE HOME RIGHT THEN!)  so anyways I go upstairs & they threw a surprise little lunch going away party for me in the conference room=)!  it was so sweet!  and as a present, julia gave me these sunglasses she used to wear in 1964 that are big and checkerboard b/c she said they looked like they would fit me-she always calls me marlo (thomas) or gidget-heehee.  anyways so lunch-yum-i took a bunch of polaroids of people & stuff (which i'll post).  then, back to work.  a couple hours later.... ....i'm sitting in my little cubicle using my computer & the tv over my head that plays cnn only goes static.  i didn't think too much of it.  then i notice the lighting is weird.  i look up and the light right above me is flickering, but everyone else's is fine.  then-ZAP!  tv, lights, computers, etc are all out.  i go over to where my sister & the departments i work with are & we're all just like what the???  someone looks out the window & says how the traffic lights are out & people in other buildings are looking out at us & the street too.  the building alarm is going off.  someone comes around and says we have to leave so we all grab our bags & walk down the stairs.  masses in the streets!  no traffic lights!  no one knows what the hell is going on & some people are getting nervous.  we're all waiting around to see what happens when one of my bosses with a radio says that the power is out-blablabla (you all know it by now).  so the boss says we should all go home-does anyone need a place to stay, etc.. me, my sister, amy & 2 other new jerseyans decide to walk to port authority from where we are.  walking the streets of nyc was insane.  HORDES of people walking in the heat, cars and trucks going everywhere b/c of no traffic direction (a hot dog truck almost hit me).  masses of people outside the ny public library.  finally we get to port authority & like everyone else finds out-no buses.  (i snapped a shot of the crowd outside).  so we walk to the lincoln tunnel, they aren't letting people walk through it.  (there's a bunch of people trying to get rides from cars that aren't moving anyways).  so we go to the ferry and join the  MOB .  (i snapped 2 shots of the crowd there, too).  so-yeah-we wait packed in with 100,000+ people in the heat to get on the ferry.  it was so crazy that people were ripping open the fence to get into the crowd.  (i snapped a shot of amy holding the fence open.)  there were like 10 helicopters hovering over us-sirens everywhere-pandemonium!  everyone kept saying how on 911 it was so much easier to get home cause there was some sort of order.  there was a 1 week late pregnant lady among us who had to be taken away bc she went into labor!  anyways so after waiting for hours and hours and hours on the line, it becomes dark out and finally cools off a bit.  luckily, one light turns on right by the ferry entrance at which point the crowd cheers.  so FINALLY we get on the platform (one of the people with us starts yelling NEW JERSEY I CAN SEE YOU!!)  and we get on the ferry.  (they couldnt tell us where the ferry would go-we'd just have to get on one).  so we get dropped off in weehawken.  after walking and walking and waiting and waiting we have to walk from weehawken to hoboken to my sister's apartment-but i didn't care bc i was finally out of the city.  so we stop at this place and get gatorades and literally inhale them for lack of hydration.... ....LUCKILY my sister's apartment was one of the few who had regained power.  b/c of traffic i stayed there (as did a bunch of her friends whose apartments DIDN'T have power).  my parents said at our house we didn't have power either, so that was even more of a reason for me to stay.  but-her elevator wasnt' working.  as we climbed the stairs to her apartment we both agreed that we felt like we had just been to war.  i said 'this is one for the bloooojjjjj'...after inhaling food & talking to everyone about our days while we watched 'drive me crazy', we went to SLEEP. ...i woke up today and finally my phone worked!! but my body felt like lead.  (thanks rosemary for everything!)  what was everyone else's experiences like??"

"On a slightly more serious note, our source in the Political Science department raises an interesting question.  If Roe v. Wade were overturned and abortion made illegal, how would you punish the women who recieved illegal abortions?  Would you equate their actions with murder, manslaughter, or would you ignore their transgression in order to pursue the doctors who provide illegal abortions?  PS seems to think that prosecuting the doctors would be the best choice: after all we are dealing with a generation of women who were raised with the notion that a fetus is not a human being at all (what exactly it is otherwise, I have never found out).  How could you hold a person responsible for their actions if they didn't think they were doing something wrong?  How could they have the pre-requisite  mens rea    for murder if they never intended to kill \"another human being?\"  An interesting proposal...put aside whatever your views are on abortion (pro-choice/pro-life) and think about this...I'm still thinking about it myself, as I think it's a difficult and interesting puzzle.  Comments???"
"Hey, what's the late penalty for filing taxes?  I finally filed my taxes (through free e-file through H&R Block) but it didn't get \"officially\" filed with the IRS until today.  I mean, it's a tiny return.  What more can they take out of it?  My visit with the dermatologist went okay.  He was a bit condescending and I had to make sure he didn't just see me for five minutes.  I mean, I've heard the spiel before.  I made sure he understood that I tried a lot of things and he better be damn sure he's diagnosing  me  and not what statistically I'd be.  But I made an appointment to see him again in two weeks, and if I have to pay the deductible again, then that's just gonna  suck .  I've already spent $50 this week for doctor's visits (PCP and dermatologist), and next week I'm seeing my PCP again for a physical, and the week after that will be the dermatologist again.  Sigh.  What I liked about Korean doctors was that they would \"cook the books\" so that we wouldn't have to pay the deductible.  I mean, it's dishonest... but if I end up seeing this dermatologist every other week, then I'll be spending $50 a month on office visits alone.  On the job front, the comission is going so-so.  I haven't had much time to work on it, but then, right now it's just brainstorming ideas for names.  I think he basically wants to see which name can come up with the coolest logo.  Well, I can't work on it until after my shift tonight, anyway.  It's weird, I used to look forward to working.  In the beginning, at least.  Then it got to be so-so, but otherwise okay.  Now... well, it's weird, but the hours before I have to work, I just get this deep feeling of dread in my core.  Kinda like when I was working for that collectibles company.  You know that feeling when you just want to get out and  you're just watching the clock going through the motions 'til time's up?  Well, I was like that at that company.  At my store?  It's kinda like that, though we're much too busy to be able to watch the clock.  But right when I first get on shift, I just feel this sense of being trapped.  I guess being busy helps cuz right when I'm feeling the worst of it, that's when I get my break.  I think what makes it less like that other job is that the interaction with the customers makes it so much better.  I'm not just in my head the entire time.  I don't have time to wallow in my sucky life.  (Okay, I gotta go, but one last thing I want to rant about relating to my doctor visit.  He asked me what type of soap I was using.  I told him it was this one that I bought from a cosmetics company that's suppose to be hydrating cuz it's made of olive oil and it's okay for sensitive skin.  Well, he told me to stop using it.  So now I feel like going to that store and slamming that expensive soap on their counter and demanding a refund, albeit a year later.  It made me realize that we were  duped .  I wish I can sue them for false claims.  They reassured me that all that stuff we bought was okay for sensitive skin.  Stupid Koreans.  Stupid sales people.  That's why I never pressure anyone to buy more than they initially ask for at the store.)"
"Well, ok, busy last few  days. Definitely. Fun though. Tuesday evening I had a sectional, which royally  sucked. I was so aggravated and...I just eneded up ending it early because I was  so frustrated. I talked to Erica and Peter for a bit afterward and then came  home. They cheered me up a bit, definitely.   Then, yesterday was Six  Flags of course. That was a ton of fun. On the way to Diane's house, Alex pulled  into a driveway to turn around, but it was on Wherli and the street was super  busy and you couldn't really see. the cars from the drivers seat, so Matthew was  telling him when to go and stuff and when we finally almost went, Matthew goes,  \"Go after this SUV...no, not this one, this one. FU**IN' GO NAVSKI!!!\"    Ah, it toally made my day and it was only 7:45 in the morning. W  etotally peeled backward out of the driveway.   Six Flags was awesome too  of course. We got on all the rides we wanted to. It wasn't nwarly as crowded as  last time. I didn't feel very well for part of the day, but it was fine.    Then, in the line for Raging Bull (the first time) Alex found this ring  on the ground and Matthew was like, \"oh, give it to me.\" And...he proposed to  me. Haha. So, now I'm engaged. Good times. My engagement ring is a nice elastic  five dollar ring. At least it's not from a cracker jack box. :)   And, oh  gosh. I've never loved teacups as much as I did yesterday. It was amazing.  Matthew and Alex spun us SO super fast. It was insane. \"the g forces!!!!! I feel  like I'm having a baby!!!!\"   Haha. Fun, FUN times. And of course, we went  on Raging Bull as the last part of the day. That's becoming tradition. Last ride  of the day, front row. It was awesome. Matthew brought a pretzel up. Haha. It  was crazy, when we started to go down, he held it out and it like...hovered for  a second or two and then flew up and off. It was crazy.   Then, unfortunately comes the worst part of the day. On our way out, there were a few lanes of traffic leaving and then one lane for incoming traffic. Well, there was a car going through the incoming traffic and, of course it was going faster than the rest because there wasn't nearly as much incoming traffic. Well, we all heard this big boom. We seriously thought it was a fender bender. And, we heard all these people screaming and yelling, and we didn't understand at first, but as we got farther up, we saw that it wasn't another car that the first car hit. It was a person or people. We weren't sure how many people the car hit. At least seven police cars came, two ambulances, and a fire truck. I just...couldn't believe that a car hitting a person could make a sound like that. It just wont get out of my head. I just keep hearing it. It sounded like when the guy rear ended me a few weeks ago. That's not a sound a car should make when hitting a person. I'm looking around in the newspapers trying to find information about it, but I've been unsuccessful so far.   It was just....such a shock. None of us knew what  to do. We wanted to help somehow, but we knew we couldn't. We went to Steak 'N  Shake, but I wasn't really all that hungry after that.   So, I said a  prayer for all the people involved. It's just that sound keeps reverberating in  my head. And, as we were driving by, the sound of that woman screaming and  crying, \"I was going so slow, I was going so slow!!!\"   It honestly just  brings me to tears.   But, life must go on. I feel bad for going on with  my life when someone else may have died. It's just an awful thought. I guess I  have to though. I mean, it does no good for me to sit and dwell about it. All I  can do is pray for all parties involved.   Today, I went and...well, I was  a rebel. Diane knows what I'm talking about. :) It actually wasn't bad at all.  I'm happy.   And, I talked to Carson FINALLY! :) It was super. She told me  about an old jr. high teacher that's being investigated for sexual harassment of  some sort I guess. I'm not surprised. She was even questioned. I might be too.  I'm scared. the one time I was questioned by a police officer scared the heck  out of me, but I was only in sixth grade. I'm sure I could handle being  questioned by the superintendant...TP. It's just weird to think that he's  finally being investigated. We all kind of thought he was creepy, but...yeah.  It's sscary to think it's actually happening now.   Well, I've written  enough for now, and I need to go out with friends...or something. I need some  fun :) Woo. Later days."
"Whenever I die, and with God's permission, I will come back and haunt my best friend who beats himself up for being lazy while I went off to die.  Unlike most apparitions who appear white as if to wear a sheet, I will wear a baseball cap, jeans, and green sweatshirt.  Hopefully with the help of others my friend's life will be reviewed on a series of minimalists sets where long emotional soliloquies are interrupted by short one liners.  Off in the dark an audience will sit in silence, letting each word sink in and stopping to laugh when the time is right."

"What does everyone think of the new \"Shpiel of the Week\" column at the side?   Basically it's where I use a keyword, and spin a paragraph around it.

"I was trying on my prom dress and shoes today. I had to use the strapless bra, which, agitated me so much it wasn't funny. I looked pretty good- I was shocked. You see- Im not a dress person. I will do whatever is possible to never be seen in a dress. But it was different with this dress. I felt like a princess, and trust me, I AM NOT A PRINCESS. I'm actually, quite far from. I'm a tom-boy. Lol. And no, that is not code for I am lesbian- so just shove it.    I'm so excited!!  I really can't wait. I just wish someone was here in hickville with me that day ;-D. You know who you are :-P. Btw- Everyone expect pictures in may. I will be sending them!   Now for some lyrics  I love this song!! So I had to post it!   I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you   You know that you love me... so- just tell me!"

"I'm sorry, some people really just don't get it.  This time, I'm not going to play the part of the guy who is always around to hang out...for people to come back to when they come up with the time.  My priorities might be different and might include my friends first (seeing as how they  are  my family, basically), but this doesn't make my priorities entirely incompatible with others.  It has happened far too much the past year.  There's a happy medium, but when all I see is an inability to find the common ground on another's part, then I have no time to reserve for that person.  Sorry, but when this happens, I'll have to turn down the part of the ugly friend who can't get his own date and who is around whenever you need someone.  I rather put my time and efforts into those who are more interested in me than some service I can provide them in their time of need.  Have a good one."

"Today, we started the \"fence project\".   We got some people together (Larry's Dad, Bryan, Holly and JD) to help us out, and so far it's going very well.   I've never had a yard with a fence, but now it seems essential with Britty and an aging dog we would rather have roaming more freely.   We've been going since 9:30 this morning, and the uprights are all in and the cement is curing.    It's a lot of work, especially for Larry and our helpers.  Yesterday, we went to Mutual's Family Day at the Zoo.   I always enjoy the zoo, but this time it was better with an IMAX movie (Caves) and all the tram and carousel rides we wanted.  The zoo is pretty tiring on foot, so I appreciated the tram.  Britty seems to be in \"no mode\" lately.   Everything people tell her to do, she either ignores or says \"no\" to.  Britty wants to do what Britty wants to do.  That must end soon.  :-)   It's just one of those phase things, I'm sure.   Sometimes I get through to her and she tells people, \"My mom's in charge.\"    I just like to remind her that she is not the boss of me, but quite the opposite.   Sometimes, I just have more patience than others, is all. lol"
"Never Talk to Strangers  I'm usually not one of those people who start conversations with complete strangers in the check out line. I'm just not. (I guess I'm a little shy.) But for good reason, as illustrated by this story of my failed attempt at doing just that. This week, I ran to the store to pick up just a couple things, didn't even get a basket. I'm in the check out line, and the couple behind me are chatting about the headlines on the tabloids. I thought perhaps to make friendly, and shared a comment that should have proved to further enlighten them on the subject. (OK, they were talking about why the tiger attacked Roy, and I volunteered the part about how the hair-do lady had tried to pet the tiger) They made some reply, looked at each other, whispered something, and PROMPTLY MOVED TO ANOTHER LANE!  I can only imagine what they said, \"let's get away from this crazy blonde\" or \"I can't believe she'd actually  talk  to us\" or \"she knows  way  too much about tiger petting!\"  I will never talk to someone in the check out lane again!"
"Highlight of the day (so far): Driving to work, mailing my bills so I have one less thing to worry about, and PIZZA PARTY for lunch!    Lowlight (so far): Knowing that the pizza is going to come from Avers.   *spew*    What can I say?  I'm in a good mood.  You should see my living room right now.  It's about a third filled up with boxes.  I've been trying to hit the kitchen all week and haven't made it there yet.  I did tape all of my Pizza Express cups together last night, though.  I just don't see the point in wasting a box on them when packing tape works so well.  Oh, and when I bought the first rolls of packing tape, I got a sample of that tear by hand stuff.  I don't know if I like it or not.  I certainly don't trust it.  I used it to tape the tops of boxes, not the bottoms, and even then I didn't use it that much.  I used it for other things, but I can't seem to remember what those things were now.    Why so interested in tape all of the sudden?  It's my life, baby!  Yea!  And I'm just in a good mood.  Don't fight it, just giggle with me...:)"
"Wala lang.... feeling ko ansama sama ngayong araw na'to. First, ang aga-aga kong nagising... hinde ko alam kng bakit maaga ako nagising. Tas pagktapos nun, nagmass kami tas hinde ko alam na ang jolog-jolog ng suot ko kasi mejo lumilipad ung utak ko kasi nga soooOOOoooper inaantok ako! hahahahahaha! Naku, kung may nakakita sa akin, pagtatawanan siguro ako ng malakas! hahahahaha syete.... an sama talaga! Pagdating ko sa bahay, sumakit yung chan ko kaya an tagal ko sa banyo! [hehehehe, darn that pizza last night! pizza nanaman kinain namin nung lunch!]  After ko i-check kung there's something new sa \"Friendster\", nanuod ako ng CSI tas kinamot ko yung mata ko and it turned bloody red! Feeling ko wala na kong mata... feel ko its covered with blood! Tas, nilagyan ko ng eye drops tas nagviolin ako with one eye closed para kumalat yung gamot sa mata ko. Pagkatapos ng isang oras na nakakangawit na pagtugtog ng violin [at iisang piyesa lang ang tinutugtog ko... dahil hinde ko masundan yung tape... well that's another story..], an sakit paren ng mata ko, feel ko pa rin wala na akong left eye... luckily, dumating yung mommy ko and praised me sa pagtutugtog ko ng violin at sinabing gumagaling na raw ako! [hahahaha!] tas napansin nya na nakapikit yung mata ko tas sinabi ko na masakit yung mata ko. Since my mom is an optalmologist, tinignan nya yung \"bloody\" left eye ko tas sabi nya namamaga yung mata ko and warned me for the last time na: \"wag na wag mong kakamutin yung mata mo!\" Aion, nilagyan niya ng ibang klaseng eye drops and closed my eye for another hour and i feel much better now. Pero namumula parin. Sinisisi ko yung allergies ko na namana ko sa tatay ko. Lahat ata namana ko sa tatay ko: asthma, allergicrhinitis, sungking ngipin [same tooth and same side] yung shape ng big toe namin, yung nose bridge namin, yung mukha [girl version raw ako ng tatay ko] eyes and yellow teeth! Kaasar, hinde ko nakuha ang katalinuhan nya sa chemistry! heheheh... well, we still have our differences like I'm a good swimmer/athlete/violinist [kinakareer na!]! Hinde makasabay yung tatay ko sa technology. He doesn't even know how to send emails or use the internet for crying out loud! Ginagamit lang nya yung computer kapag maglalaro ng freecell at microsoft powerpoint. Ang rami rami nyang high tech stuff-> laptop, palmtop, digi cam [yan lang ata ang nagagamit nya ng matino!... pati rin pala yung laptop!], dvd player... ang rami!

"Holiday Parties galore!   This past weekend Alan and I went to 3 holiday gift exchange parties! 3 parties in 3 days!! I think I lost a lot of precious sleep, but it's ok cuz I had a lot of fun!  On Friday night, we partied it up at Diana and Mark's house in E. Palo Alto with all our Santa Clara friends.  For the gift exchange, I ended up with this nice set of martini glasses.  Alan ended up with a crockpot that he really wanted... or did he?  We also played The Twleve Days of Christmas Unplugged, where we make up our own gifts for the song.  Some were pretty funny...  On Saturday night, we had a party at Alan's house with all of his SHC (high school) friends.  Lots and lots of food at this party!! It seems like all his HS friends always bring tons and tons of food! It was yummy.  For the gift exchange, I got the Finding Nemo DVD and a $10 giftcard to Starbucks.  We also had a gag gift exchange, and I got this little nail cutting kit (with clippers, tweezers, etc.)  Alan ended up with a box of old party favors! It was pretty funny.  On Sunday afternoon, we went over to Jane & Oscar's place in Oakland to get together with all our friends from Cal.  Yummy food there too... there was adobo, lumpia, Zachary's pizza, lasagna, and lots and lots of wine.  For that gift exchange, I got the new Alicia Keys CD.  We also played MAFIA, and I almost got away with being the 'killer', but David and Jane caught me.  For all the pics, check out Alan's photo  urlLink gallery !    LOTR III   Tonight we're going to see  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King  at Union Landing with my ex-coworkers from Incyte.  Since I saw the first one (two years ago) with them during the workday (hehe), we're getting together again!  I'm so excited!! Alan and I watched the second one last night, just to refresh our memories!  Can't wait to see Legolas and Aragorn! :)    One month!   It's been one month exactly today since I started working again! Time flies by so quickly when you're earning money :) heheh."
"ready for the world (again).    urlLink    i really should be banned from blogging at this hour.  i think too much for my own good too.  my new found tom friend is cool. he  urlLink writes  pretty damn good.  i made a huge mistake the other night. guilt is definitely not my good friend.   five player scrabble games are cool.  my test results come out on wednesday. i hope i don't need another jab or course of something. it is such a pain to be sick.  i am such a whiny little brat.  it is hard to end a game when you are stuck with all vowels.  i have to bribe the literati gods.  pop tarts at two in the morning make me laugh.  i'm sleepy.  i have a long rant in my head but it won't come out.   i really talk too much for my own good.  my dad's throwing me a party.  i don't really want a party.  sheesh.  and on a more serious note..  i've noticed lately that a lot of bloggers seem to be coming clean. i did that today. i gave an old friend the blog address because she asked if i still had that thing online. i really wasn't sure how she would take it, i am anticipating that she might take it really badly, not because of what i've said here but rather the connection of racheal in the real world and racheal online.   i've struggled lately, to really sorta come to bring them together. that comfortable place where i do not need to pretend nor am i insecure with how much i am revealing.    and it. is. Hard.   i wonder if i want to give out this address to people in my real world. my mom used to read my old blog, i think it was too painful for her but today, she asked me again if it was okay if she came and read this one. i haven't answered her, i don't really think i can prevent her from coming in. it is more of like a trust thing, she knows i will know if she came in here and all i have hanging on it is her word to not come in here and read what i have to say unless i'm okay with it.  i guess i'm really sorta overprotective then. because this really is my baby. i designed it, i made it, i pored over it but most of all, everything inside here is a mirror image of me. i know every nook and corner and what it represents. i have found writing to be my best tool of honesty for faces can decieve and lie.   i am slightly shaken and unsure about this but yet the trepiditation(sp?) of being free to be who i am and what i am excites me. i vowed in my old blog to only write for me but then as the numbers increased and as i began to realize that my written word affected people i started censoring myself. i really hope that does not happen again.  i do not want to use my blog to hurt people. i have done it countless other times before. because writing is mostly my safe place and writing it out is how i make sense of the situation, me using the words that formed sentences onto the screen through my mind at that very moment has made a mark and causes a reaction or a significant effect.   i want this to be a medium of self discovery yet i also wish for it to be a platform for the things i believe in. i like meeting new people and the brilliant new and old friendships that have formed and bonded through this medium has never ceased to amaze me. i am thankful and grateful yet there are times where i wish i could turn back the hands of time and begin again.  i can't but can only turn over this chapter and rewrite my story.  will you rewrite it with me please?  jared and i talked. it hurt but things are starting to look up again, it's ended yet this is a good ending. i think i'm beginning to like life again...now isn't that scary?   urlLink  \"but there's nothing wrong with that. its your site.  you can write long stuff if you want.  you can write short stuff if you want.  you can write 'cheese' in six inch high letters if you want.\""
"Hey gals! Been ready to 'tie my shoelaces' (which is tricky considering I'm wearing clogs) a couple of times today.  People just don't get it here and they never will.  (I *know* that sounds horribly negative, but it's really true, sad to say.)  I'm not sure I'm going to make it here five more years- it's going to take more patience than I think I can muster.  I'm quickly getting to that \"I don't care\" attitude again, I mean, if I've voiced my concerns and they don't do anything that actually helps, then why should I care anymore at that point?  I'll get done what I can, and what I can't, well that's tomorrows were made for.  (If you gals knew me better & for a long while, you'd know that \"I don't care\" practically doesn't exist for me- I prolly couldn't be further from it, which is what makes it so hard for me to deal with huge loads--it's just in me, I *have* to care...I just need to care less than I do).  Hard to explain, but maybe ya'll see what I mean?    Leslie!  Glad to see you posting again!  Sounds like you had a great few days on vacation!  Sorry you got stuck with CNN....bummer!  \"Sarah seranaded us on the way home with \"I don't HAVE any school tomorrow!\" For four hours.\"- I'm sorry, but I LMAO- girl, you have a great way of sayings, and your humor always makes me laugh.  Kids say/do the darndest things.  My sister sang the Gilligan's Island theme for most of the 6 hour trip to San Diego one time when she was about 5. LOL-I'll bet my parents had fun with us on that trip- I was about ready to tape her mouth shut!  I'll be one of the first in line to buy your cookbook!!  All the meals you describe always sounds soooo goooood!!    Sherry- got the email- thanks!  I needed that! :-D    Melissa- Girl, where have you been?  What's your excuse?   LOL!!  Sounds like you got a lot of insight to wedding shooting- that's great!  \"JJ said the next lady is more paticular about what she wants\"- hopefully she doesn't turn into a bridezilla!  I would think that would be the worst part of shooting weddings is working with a difficult bride.  Otherwise it sounds like a lot of fun, especially when (in your case) you have an eye for light, etc.    OK- gotta finish my lunch & get a couple of things done.   Later!"

"So I'm happy that things with Pat and I worked out and that were ok for now. I'm glad that although we were both (he mostly) hurt by my desicion we are still going to remain friends. Also I wanted to throw something out there. How many times are you suppose to forgive someone and take that person back. So yes, I am referring this to Jeremy and Richie. I love you both and care for you both deeply but you two should nto eb together. You had your time and I don't think it would work again. Why possibly hurt eachother and risk any future you could possibly have together? I personally think you two are very different people looking for different things and do not have much in common besides the fact that you both care about eachother. And for those of you who read this and did not understand my blog posting last night, it was not about Jeremy and Richie. Don't comment unless you know what the hell I'm talking about. Thats all I have to say at the moment, besides for the fact that I'm bored out of my mind and have a lot of crap to do today and don' t know when I'm going to get it done. Oh and Pease, Pat wants to be a part of our blog. So invite him please. Oh, so my sweater is making me sneeze like no other. I don't understand what is wrong and I'm like breaking out in tiny hives. Oh geez. Alright people I am off and on to do the history homework that I avoided doing last night which means I ignore my spread on boys cross country, make me gag. Oh well, you can't do and get everything out of life. I am off."
"Hey I am using this tool called  urlLink Blog buddy .  It is pretty cool.  Not too much went on this weekend.  I was glad to get the extra sleep this weekend.  I am watching  urlLink  Smallville   while typing this so it may be a little scatter in thought...  Halloween is tomorrow.  The pumpkins on the fromt porch has lasted two weeks and I for one is very impressed.  I thought for sure they would have been smashed 24 hours into the first weekend.  We are dressing up for work tomorrow.  Dave got us all doctor scrubs and lab coats.  We are going to be an ER, which I think is quite fitting in the computer scheme of things, but then again I am a geek.  Things at work are getting better with the new seat.  I feel like more of the team now, but I miss talking to Sue all day.  I went and saw \"Don't Tell Anna\" this weekend and then Ann had everyone over for a party.  It was a very fun party.  Ann has a very unique talent for meeting and getting to know really interesting and cool people.  I really like that about her...  So this would be a good time to send a shout out to our newest readers Judy, Ed and Eddie...well I guess they could read it to Eddie.    I haven't heard rom Kristin in awhile.  I have tried to stay active online so I could talk to her.  She is probably pretty busy.  She did update her  urlLink blog , but I didn't understand the post at all (ahmmm...that means Kristin send me an email)...  Okay, I am going to go finish watching Smallville...until then..."
"Weekend Update  This weekend has been fun so far... Except I'm working right now... Last night was Carni Night... very fun.  SM did an awesome job as usual.  CP our youth admin/catalyst brought a visitor, I think she is hooked as a volunteer.  Funny like that.  Once people experience the ministry, they probably either are way too scared of it, or want totally in.  Had a very late meal with K. Hung out today with some good friends of ours that used to go to Grace.  Some very cool things happening with them in Montgomery County.  They are helping pull together married small groups in MD for McLean Bible, powerhouse of the Beltway. Went to a birtdhay party for a couple that are old friends of ours tonight.  They turn 40.  Yikes.  40 in age, definitely not in spirit.  It was great to hang out with them. Tomorrow is Bridging the Gap Sunday, where we have church on the new property.  It's going to be pretty neat, except, earlier tonight, it was pouring.  If there is bad weather, we do church like normal.  Which will be kind of a disappointment...  On the way home tonight, D and I stopped in the park and ride lot to pray for tomorrow and for the land and the building.  My prayer is that the building  brings us even closer as a church to God's mission in the world and that we don't worship the building.  We will see. K leaves for Kstan on Monday.  Him and two other guys from the 03 boys are going.  Very exciting.  These poor guys have just had a whirlwind - they've been home from college after finishing their freshmen year just less than a week and then off they go to Kstan.  Pretty crazy but what a great experience.  K's got this great attitude about not knowing at all what to expect.  I think that's what Erwin refers to as bringing more chaos into our environments..."
"Jesus: The Virgin Mary a \"Frigid Bitch\"    In the urlLink  diaries  Jesus calls the Virgin Mary a \"frigid bitch\", and describes his experiences of taking marijuana and LSD and having sex with Mary Magdelene.   Now this sounds like my kind of book. I do agree that god must have a sense of humor I mean, look at the platypus for chrisake.  There are way too many reactionary christians that get offended way too easily. First reaction of course is to ban the book! Ban ideas that are different than our own. Insanity. If you don't like the book don't read it, no one is forcing you.  In the mean time, at least admit it's funny..."

"Wow, surprised naman ako at nakapag post kayo agad. It's a bummer that you guys have to extend your vacation. Now, I'm starting to feel like blog friends nalang tayo. Boohoo. It's okay, though. I understand. I just could not stand the fact that I'll be dealing with my professors' faces until the end of the month. Can you imagine, I'm starting to have dreams about them. What could be worse than that? Sana hindi naman omen yun. Baka mamaya I'd end up married to Noel (yung pina inom ni Chris dati, Selena.). Hell no.  Grabe Allan, okay yang lugar nyo diyan ah. Dalhin mo naman kami jan minsan. Ghost hunting tayo (sabay ako ang una mag chicken out.) I'm sorry to hear what you're going through now. Ganyan din dinaan ng family ko last year. Ganun talaga eh. Don't worry pag balik mo dito, inuman tayo lahat samin.   Selena, thanks sa pasalubong. Have fun on your vacation. Pagbalik niyo dito inuman tayo. Sana nagpadala ka kay Allan ng copy ng PULP if ever magkikita kayo. Si Trista, tumangkad na lalo. She can sit by herself now. She can also stand by herself while holding on to the railings of her crib. Cute. Kaya lang she's starting to have \"stranger anxiety.\" Just found out this evening when one of her ninongs dropped by for a visit. Nangingilala na. Kaya pagbalik mo, dalasan niyo ni Chris pagbisita.  I feel so sorry for those people na hindi sha madalas makita or never pa nakita. I predict that they won't have a welcoming greet from my daughter.  Sige, I'll be looking forward to seeing you all soon.  Love and Slack,  Ayn Ruth Baudelaire"
"Work still goes well.  The team are all getting on really well with each other, and the trainers are still dead decent. They are equally amenable to ripping the arse out of breaks as we are, which is good. I can get away with collossal amounts of sarcasm, which is good. And the material that we're learning is easy as hell, which is good. I'm upgrading one of the team to B^2 as well.  Away from work, bought Tiger Woods 2004 for the PS2 at the weekend. It's really good, and so far it hasn't fallen into the trap of getting repetitive like most golf games do. With 20-odd courses, I don't expect it to either.  There's actually many PS2 games that I want coming out in the next no-very-long-at-all. Pro Evo 3 on Friday (I wasn't actually gonna get this straight away, but Gamestation are doing a deal where you get 15 trade in on Pro Evo 2. Which means it'll only cost 25. w00t.   Following on form that, there's Smackdown 5 in November, and also Worms 3D's out about then as well, which I'm looking forward to. Then we've got GT4 and MGS3 in the new year.  Saw Cabin Fever on Saturday night. It's been badly misadvertised, it's not the scary experience they hyped it as, I found it gory and amusing in equal measure. There's not really much tension in the movie at all. But it's still enjoyable. I'd recommend seeing it, if only for the leg-shaving scene.  Helped Steve and Kat move stuff last night, they're pretty much completely moved into their new flat, which is looking good. Was meant to be going over to IKEA with Steve to pick up some stuff, but there was someting up with the steering, so I wasn't going all the way over there. Dropped it into the garage today, and it turns out the tyres were just underinflated.   On the subject of car trouble, we passed a car that was in the middle of burning to a crisp while heading from EK to Newton Mearns. Rubbernecking ahoy.  Not much else on the go, still waiting on the bastard dole office paying my final amount that they owe me. I get a nasty suspicion that they're gonna try and screw me out of it, but I'll have that money, even if I have to resort to fraud.  Bye for now."
"urlLink sacbee.com -- Business -- Hot debate over biotech wheat : \"In a critical step forward for biotech wheat, the Food and Drug Administration soon is expected to complete its safety and nutrition review of Monsanto's latest product, hard red spring wheat -- a favorite of bakers -- that is genetically engineered to withstand doses of the popular weedkiller Roundup.    The FDA's review, while voluntary on the company's part, is the first regulatory sign-off for a product that still is likely a few years from being grown in this country.\"   On one hand, I've been beaten into Zen regarding the evil advances corporations are making toward GM foods. I think the junk will be approved under this administration, and maybe it will be a nice energizing boost to stores like Whole Foods and Cid's that care about the quality of products they provide. On the other hand, I hate, hate, hate the biotech movement. Let's all go  urlLink slow food ."

"Oh wow! Righto... Sorry for not blogging yesterday. Time and energy doesn't permit me to. I will narrate in just a bit.  &nbsp;  Monday  &nbsp; Hmm. I spent the day in misery, with hacking coughs every now and then. So miserable. I felt like vomitting all day long, but I don't dare to. Heh. &nbsp; Right. Nothing really interesting happened. Okay. I missed PE, because I can't run while coughing, or else all my vomit comes out.  &nbsp; Hmm.... Right. Today during choir, Miss Ong didn't come because she was sick. Poor thing! I hope she feels better soon. Okay. We sang  Sing &amp; Rejoice  and  One Song Many Voices  all day long! Ayioh...I was unable to reach the high notes. Keep having to shut up on the high notes, which thankfully, is at the end of the phrases. &nbsp; Yeah. Guess what? I got in the MDIS performance! HaHa. Well, there was no choosing la. All the boys got in. Guess there's a desperate lack of boys, eh? Gloria got in as well...weee! Okay. We learnt that MDIS's coperate song. So lame and corny. HaHa. You should hear the girls laugh as the boys sang that \"management training\" bit...it's like we have to suddenly cresendo and go high pitch at \"meh\" (it goes like: MEHHH-neg-ment\"). HAHAHA! Yeah. &nbsp; Okay. I managed to persuade Mother to let me stay home from school today. Yeah. I don't feel like going to to school tomorrow la. I came back at 9, ate dinner till 10 and I have virtually no time to do homework. Plus, I fell asleep. Yeah. I have no mood to mass PE (what if Mr Ang don't allow me NOT to PE??), and I haven't finished my Chem yet, and I don't want to face the wrath of Mrs Tay. O.O &nbsp; Oh my god! How can I forget to say this?!!! I scored more points with Mr Jeremy today! First, he said he liked my English file and my comments for the articles.  Well done , he said! Ain't that something? *flashes wide grin* Also, I didn't participate in the debate, but I wrote points for everyone! I have written CQ's point, and guess what? Mr Jeremy said that CQ is the only one who touched on the topic of censorship is not nedded. His point, or rather mine, is that self-censorship is enough, and renders government censorship useless. Muhahaha! Double score for me! Take that, you idiot MCP (He has proven that he is indeed an MCP through and through. He supported the boys' group, which is us, rather than the girls' group,&nbsp;even though the topic we argued is not what he supports. Who wants his support? Eeeee!)! &nbsp;  Today  &nbsp; Righto. Today, I woke up at 8.30. :P to all of you who are in school at that time. I get to sleep late, and you don't! :P :P :P Right. Lets not make the masses angry (and jealous), alright? &nbsp; Okay okay. Enough joking. I went to AMK to eat some ku meen (for refresher, it means mushroom shredded chicken noodles, aka the best noodles in the world)! Ahh! Heavenly! I can't get enough of them! KU MEEN!!!  &nbsp; After that, we brought some supplies, then went back home. I did my homework (drew 2 graphs..haha), came online for awhile, then went to eat lunch.  &nbsp; After lunch at Admiralty Place (kuay chap), it was to the doctor's. After getting MC, we went to AMK again to shop for hats and whatnot. I brought a pair of black&nbsp;leather (I think fake one...but who knows?) shoes. My old one was too small, and childish I might add. Yeah. &nbsp; Okie. The rest is not really worth mentioning. Okay, I got lotsa tidbits from CQ about today. Okay. Most interesting tidbit. Today in Chem, Mrs Tay got rather upset and scolded the class. Apparently, John fell asleep and that led onto a tirade that seemed to incriminate the whole class. She apparently feels that whenever she steps into S22, she feels like losing her temper. Is our class so hard for her to handle? Sigh...yue wang ar! I am so glad I didn't come. &nbsp; O.O! We are supposed to go attend this SAF talk tomorrow. Apparently, me and CQ are selected by Ah Tham. Luckily, tomorrow we have this dress rehearsal at Swissotel for the choir and we can escape this nightmare. However, that CQ did not tell Mr Tham that the choir cats are not going. Neither did JunSheng try to save himself. HAIYOH!!! Qi shi wor leh! We are supposed to tell Tham ma...so he can select 3 other cats. If we tell him tomorrow, it will be too late to make last-minute arrangements. I felt rather upset and irrtated that CQ and JS didn't do anything lor!! It's like I everytime have to be the one who informs the teacher leh. Honestly! What's so hard about speaking to the teacher? Qi shi wor!! Ergh...  &nbsp; Okay...calm down. Calm down. Right. I think I gotta go le. Read a story. Heh. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!"

"In the summer of 2003 I went to  urlLink Clarion West . It was the best time of my life. In the winter of 2003 I had a severe depressive episode and went very close to taking my own life. In the spring of 2004 I began writing again.  My bout of depression, for several reasons, was by far the most serious Ive heard about - going into major depression is not usual after Clarion -  but my predicament was not unique. Most of us went through some kind or another of what my fellow Clarionite Gabe Morgan called Post-Clarion Stress Syndrome.  Clarion is an extremely stressful experience. I wasnt aware of it at the time, I was even a bit scornful about all these talks of how stressful, how hard, how taxing Clarion was. I had been under a not negligible amount of stress for the year and a half preceding Clarion, on account of my job (I was, perhaps will be again, a professional fiction translator)  something that contributed among other things to the gravity of my subsequent fall  and Clarion itself seemed, by comparison, loads of fun. I hadnt realized that just because youre having fun doesnt mean that you cant be under a lot of pressure. Having the time of your life  by itself  , not counting what happens when you have to go home, can be extremely hard.   But lets concentrate on what happened to me after I stopped having fun.   My position was, if not unique, peculiar among Clarionites because I was a foreigner (well, I still am, of course). English is not my native language, and I didnt reside in an English-speaking country. I come from a different culture, so along with all the rest, I was in for culture shock. Not at Clarion... when I got back. When I landed back in Milan and looked around, in the most scorching summer Italy has known so far, a shiver went through me. I felt like I was on an alien planet. If there was a bright and lively centre of the universe, I was in the place furthest from it. This was a large part of my Post-Clarion syndrome.  Another stress factor was the fact that for the six weeks of Clarion we had been spoiled, pampered brats. Our needs were, for our mums Leslie and Neile, of supreme importance. Our sleep was sacred (apart from the racket across the street, but thats another story). Ailments and discomforts were taken seriously. Conflicts were dealt with. Paperclips were provided. At the parties, we were the stars. At the readings, we were sitting in the first row. We got to stand up and be applauded.   Clarion is a hothouse, and rightly so. You are treated like the privileged guy you are, and its implied youre going to give back lots to the SF community, because the SF community gives you lots more than can be paid by your tuition fee.   Then the six weeks end. Reams of scrap paper are recycled. You leave. The others dissolve into a cloud of electrons. You go back home and youre nothing and no-one. Youve been to  what?   What is it, a kind of school? Did you win something? Its that thing about Star Trek, right?  Rapid wilting of hothouse flowers suddenly exposed to January snow.   This is all the more true if you live far from the fandom network. In large cities, especially cities like Seattle, Minneapolis, New York, where fandom is thriving and you may even have a Clarion mate practically next door, it is possible to resort to the network. But if youre in the sticks, all your achievements and pains are suddenly worth or a weight for you and you alone. I went back to Padua, Italy. A country where Science Fiction is basically dead and fantasy doesnt thrive either.   I would probably have been able to brave the slump, and the culture shock, quite well if it hadnt been for other factors. One is personal and particular but one is very Clarionite  I was one of my years Clarion divorces.   They tell me the Clarion breakup is often a result of a Clarion hookup. In my case it wasnt so. I wasnt married but I was certainly sure I was going to be in a short time. My partner had joined me at the end of Clarion and the plan was to tour the USA together. As soon as I saw him I knew that, no matter how much I loved him, our life together was over. Clarion changes you, and the rest of your life sometimes doesnt change accordingly. We went through the motion of a happy holiday anyway, were even happy together for the last time, then we came back home and he took a plane back to his home town and I havent seen him since.  The advice I would  almost  feel like giving people about the Clarion divorce is: dont. Dont take life-altering decisions in the aftermath of six weeks of intense stress, at a moment when you are high on exhilaration and exhaustion. Wait to go back to your normal life, to your routine. Settle down, get over the slump, get over the mourning for the separation and loss of leaving Clarion, and then decide.   But I wont give this advice in the end. After long internal debate I think that, sometimes, people need a push."

"The need for contact is a very real and  very important neccessity for the expansion and growth of the human being. In fact, it is so important that babies who do not recieve comfort, i.e attention, caresses, and contact, die even if they recieve all other bodily neccesities; food, shelter, non-human warmth. While this was a scientific experiment with babies, i believe that when looking at the older population we may deduce that even at such an independent age, we crave, desire, and utimetly need a warm body to touch. To a certain degree there is a sexual need, but it in no way matches the less specific need for comfort. A mother can get by on her children's love and warmth alone for very long. To have someone hug you and laugh with you and simply expirience with you is one of our greatest needs.  Let us then explore why we may need this comfort and touch. It may simply be for psychological strength, which ultimetly translates to physical strength as well. This is a probable answer. However, i propose the following: contact between humans is needed for the assertation that one exists and that such existance is important and welcomed in the universe. In the embraces of others we feel their weight, we feel their weight on our weight, thereby giving us a conscious feel of our physical body. Therefore, we exist in this form that is being touched, that weighs less or more then the body next to it, the body that is not yours and is someone else, thus giving you an identity on which to seperate yourself. The person also acts as a witness of your existence. They can verify, that you exist and play a part in their lives, thus you are important. There is reason to live when you both feel your existence and the importance of it.   Look at those who commit suicide. Aside from those who commit seppuko out of honor, suicide is done out of a deficiency in human comfort and warmth. Our existence is not noted and reinforced by someone else and thus it is neither important nor necessary in our eyes. We may also apply this explenation when seppuko is commited out of disgrace. Once you have lost the adoration or respect of others due to your failure, your existence is seen as invaluable.   In my case, this is an extremely underdeveloped thesis.I may expand it later when i find the words to explain our counter need for isolation, commonly known as \"space.\" I believe that this too has to do with our need to validify our existence."

"Friday - Cathouse. Good night, but left early due to tiredness on a grand scale. Saturday - Lazy day, then sushi. This is a good thing. Sunday - Dawn of the Dead, then Cathouse. Movie good, better than I thought it would be, and I liked the Richard Cheese action. Catty not too bad, but was quite tired, since I hadn't had much sleep at all. Gave Barry a lift home, and got to sleep about 5am.  Apologies for the above crapness, it's short attention span day here, apparently.  15 days until Vegas. People have been giving me 'orders' of stuff they'd like brought back. Some of it won't be a problem, but at this rate, I won't be able to manage it all. Bear in mind I do have a 20kg baggage limit, and I'm only taking one suitcase. So if it doesn't fit, it's not coming home with me."

"Sorry its been so long. Blogger sucks. Or, well, my computer does. Or, well, my internet does. Or, well, you know.   I bet you're all wondering how the cross-country meet went on Thursday. Even if you're not, too bad. Well, it was a longer course than usual, by like a half mile. And even though most of it was in the cool woods, there were a LOT of steep hills. Still, moving on. A lot of Chesapeake girls got in front of me, but I always sprint the last three hundred metres so I caught up to some of them. And guess what? Go on, guess! I GOT ON VARSITY!!! WHOO! There were ten Old Mill girls there, and I was within the top seven so I got a spot on Varsity and next meet we go to I'll be running with the varsity girls. Cool! Old Mill didn't do so bad at the meet, but we could've done better.  Not much happened on Friday. I was really tired though, I can tell you that. I also forgot my damn running shoes at home, so I had to run in my Vans. If you're wondering whether or not that hurts, trust me, running eight miles for Cross-Country practice in flat-footed Vans HURTS REALLY REALLY BAD. I learned my lesson, that's for sure.  Today we had a car wash for Cross-Country. It was technically free, but most people gave donations (which is what we had hoped for in the first place). We were supposed to be there from seven to twelve, but the damn field hockey people apparently had a slot starting at ten AM. I'm not blaming the field hockey girls, I'm blaming the stupid owner of the gas station we used. Still, we made $250 in two and a half hours, so I'm happy. We'll all be able to go to the end-of-season banquet, so its all good. Kendra's mom rocks! She brought what Doug so rightly called 'sustenance', or, Hershey's chocolate, apples, and Sunny Delight. AND GRAPES!!  Then I went to Jason's. It was hectic and crowded, but I did eventually get to see John. Now I'm back, finishing all my homework. I seem to have a lot this weekend. But its all really really easy. Spanish II is too easy. Way way too easy. School is a lot better than I thought it would be. Cooooooool.   Oh, and I forgot to mention something that completely pisses me off. Hannah tried out for soccer, and somehow she made it and Jess and Nora didn't. When she was going to the tryouts, she never once got a ride from her own parents. And when practice started a day or two before school she had troubles getting carpool rides because her parents \"couldn't take her\". Then, she goes to school for a whole two days and doesn't show up at all after that. On the third day of school she didn't go to classes but then got to soccer somehow. After that she just stopped coming to school and soccer altogether.  So, I'm wondering what is up with Hannah and so is Nora. I got to SpanishII yesterday and Seora calls role. When she gets to Hannah's name she goes, \"Oh yes, she got dropped.\" Now, I wasn't  sure what this meant, but I guessed that Hannah had either dropped out or she had been kicked out by the school. After school, I'm getting ready for Cross-Country and Ali is in the locker next to mine. Ali is on the soccer team, but she couldn't find an empty soccer locker so she used one of the CC lockers. And I was talking to Ali, and I asked her what was up with Hannah. She goes, \"Oh, you didn't hear? Hannah's moving!\"   Ali also went on to say that two or three other girls on the team weren't going to practice or were showing up to scrimmages saying they forgot their uniforms. This pisses me off more than anything. I know that Nora wanted a spot on the team and Jess deserved one, and they would have been dedicated to the team. So they were rejected by some Texas-Ranger soccer coach who didn't even bother looking at the Freshman in the first place, and replaced Nora & Jess with a few players that were undedicated, making stupid assumptions.   Sorry, that was my rant for the day.  I'm off punishment now, thank god. Hannah so needed to get in trouble. She was the one who did the dirty work and did most of the work in getting in trouble. Sure, I know I was wrong to let her do it, but I wasn't the one who actually did it! Her parents probably don't even know what happened. She lies like that sometimes. I'm so pissed with her. I had half the mind to call and tell her mom or dad, but then she'd probably lie to them and tell them it was all me. The thing with this is that I have never gotten into trouble for doing such a thing with any of my other friends, which leads my parents to lean to my side and blame Hannah. That's a relief. But I was still stuck on punishment for two and a half weeks and Hannah got off free.  Oh well. Life sucks sometimes.   Oh, and to add to all of that crap, my CD player is broken. Dad says a new one will be a Christmas gift. Okay, counting down the days - ahem, MONTHS until I get a new CD player. Really, its not like I'm spoiled or anything, but I'm a musician, and I neeeeeeed a way to listen to music and hook it up to my Amp for my guitar."
"i did get it thank you, haven't had much ofx a chance to listen to its yet.  Now i think you should download the Beta Band album and send me it seeing as the version i downloaded don't woik.  Either that or just buy the album and get it posted to my address."
"Well, today was good. I went to the tabernacle with Ricky and Paul because there was a big festival, too lazy to explain. I also got a better cowbell and a new hi hat stand from Guitar Center. Later on, fireworks at my cousin Murphy's house. Fun, fun, funny, fun. Happy New Years."
"ew."
"Ok, kids. Here it is, as promised  a small list of the strange and wonderful cast of Bostonites that Ive met since Ive been here. Ill try and lump them into relevant groups so you all dont get lost. Lets get started.   Frankpipe!   Frankpipe is the reason Im in Boston. Were a Zappa-esque rock band with damn near innumerable influences. Here is Frankpipe in no particular order   Sean Frenette  Best friend since high school  wicked guitar player  mildly eccentric  lead guitar   Joe Jomo? Moffett  The Pipes front man  awesome trumpet player  balls to the wall insane and funny  trumpet/lead vocals   Mike Winograd  Token Jew  best clarinet player Ive ever heard  pop music fanatic  sax/keys/vocals   Dave Goodchild  Frankpipe newbie  ungodly talented bassist   ridiculously quick study  bass   Thomas Monaghan  Buthole Bob  sick percussionist  BCB demigod  drums   Me  Dexter aka The Rev?  struggling beginner guitarist  negro extrodinaire  trombone/vocals     The Boston City Band/Wooster Brass Band/Windjammer Band/etc.    These are all actually the same band technically speaking. I wont get into it here. Check out my  urlLink previous post  concerning that whole deal. Here they are in no particular order:   Trombone Nazi(s)  - one of the many old men who play drum major from within the ranks of the BCB. They calls the tunes, they bark the starts and stops, and they critique your playing and marching no matter how awful they themselves are. Nothing is Boston City? enough for the Nazis. Oh, and if you couldnt tell from their title, they all play trombone. Theyre never really referred to by name.   The Bunny Hat Lady or Madame Vericose  -  crooked teeth, large glassy eyes, tired sallow skin, and a healthy crop of varicose veins are all her trademark features. She wears the drum major uniform but, trust me, kids, she is anything but a drum major. She, too, barks commands or, on occasion, blows her whistle. She may or may not do either in tandem with one of the Trombone Nazis  and, by the way, ALL commands given by her or the Nazis are not at all in time. She wields this drum major mace like some geriatric ninja. I would not be surprised if she had a bad case of jaundice or the gout or both. On her head, she wears this ultra-fabulous fluffy white super bonnet. Hence the title Bunny Hat Lady?.   Hardcore! Drummer  - Shes been marching parades for YEARS and, damn it, she is the very definition of a hardcore drummer when it comes to parade time. Her hands are bandaged and knotted with arthritis but she plays with the fierceness of an entire snare line. Dont get me wrong  shes not in the same class as the Nazis or the Bunny Hat Lady. She is one of the sweetest women in the BCB  super friendly, soft spoken, always smiling, and downright loveable.   The Glockenspiel Lady  - Oh boy. What a wonder! Ok. Damn the physical description. Imagine a glockenspiel player whos understanding of tonality is light years beyond that of most mere mortals. She plays  whatever she wants  regardless of the key signature (though, before each tune, she turns to ask the Trombone Nazi what key the piece is in). In all honesty, that may be an understatement. I have never once heard her play in any discernable key whatsoever. Its rather miraculous. Added to that, she marches like a cartoon character and has no concept of gate turns. Good thing she marches solo in front of the band.   Russel K. Wiesman aka Russ  - The very heart and soul of the BCB  our fearless leader. Though he does not march, Russ is responsible for everything else BCB related including doling out paychecks at the end of each parade. He often follows behind the band during parades in his trademark white van. The parade life can get hectic and, as a result, it is generally a bad idea to try and talk to Russ before a parade begins. He has no time for your nonsense.     Sometimes She Burns [ urlLink SSB ]   This is Seans older brother Kyles band. Theyre damn good. Check out their  urlLink website  w00t:   Kyle Frenette   Guitar/Vocals  My other big bro constantly looking out for me and/or filling me with beer. My storytelling skills pale in comparison.   Ken Dziok   Drums  Nasty drummer with a heart of Pabst. Newest in a long line of SSB drummers  all around decent guy.   Miguel Paucar   Guitar/Vocals  Miguel is probably my favorite guitar player to watch. The kid plays with freakish amounts of energy  goddamn you if you dont dance. Rolls his own cigarettes and, again, is an all around decent guy.    Corinto Cevallos [?]   Bass  Corinto is the only member of the band that Ive never once spoken to or interacted with in any way. He tends to disappear after shows and Ive only seen him at one party so I mean I guess thats that.      Other Friendly Neighborhood Bostonites      Brother Blue   Hes a multi-degree carrying, world traveling storyteller  Bostons official storyteller, in fact."

"Evening. As I stated last post, I have not had an extreme amount of time to post in the past week or so. At the moment, I have a few seconds of independent thought to spare, so I shall try to bring this charade of a blog up to date.  Exams have been happening of late. Quite evil, assuredly. Both English and Biology are null and void, as the exams for these have been taken care of in the Advanced Placement nonsense. We have been watching movies in Biology for a while now. Holla. Government exam is looming for tomorrow. That fuck is going to be deadly.  There really isn't that much to tell. Damn. I need more excitement...  I am currently grasping for jobs that don't grasp for me. This is upsetting. Davis-Kidd told me they would call this week, and they haven't. Damnit. I need money. Today my last check bounced. And then the bank charged three times the fucking amount of over-charging. Blah, System. So I need money.  I shall be going out with Heather Saturday night, to celebrate school's end as well as Heather's birthday. And I shall have cd's for her, filled with nonsensical tunes of power and oddity. We shall see Shrek.  Must be going. Grandparents have just arrived. Cheers."
"Yeah but, who are you voting for?   0k ok.  I started this campaign displeased with the Torys.  I don't believe that giving tax cuts to corporations will stimulate the economy.  I view that as a throw back to voodoo economics (Reganomics in the 80s), and I don't buy into the idea that helping corporations flourish actually translates to those corporations hiring more, and making more jobs.  I believe that government has a role to play in our lives, and part of that role is to provide and preserve services like health care, education, and social assistance.  I also believe that government cannot do all of those things alone, and that ballancing government provided services with privately provided services is a fine line to walk but is better in the long run.  Government cannot rely on its own agencies to spend tax money wisely.  It must regulate and control, encourage and sometimes force, those agencies to be efficient and reduce wasted spending.  But simply pitting one group against another (like unions and management) and forcing them to come to a conclusion isn't the best way to acheive those goals.  The Liberals urked me during the campaign.  I still think McGuinty is a bit of a tool in front of the camera.  The Liberals constantly used strange numbers (like assuming a 5% growth statistic, when the PCs used 3% growth) on which to base their financial figures.  God help us all if those assumptions turn out to be overestimated.  I had not considered the NDPs until the campaign swung completely towards the Liberals.  In my riding I'm not a fan of the incumbant MPP, Marilyn Churley (NDP) who cried and cried that the City of Toronto was trying to \"ram through\" an incinerator in a \"back room deal\".  It was a complete lie, and most of the media bought it as fact.  It didn't help the currently on going discussions around new and emerging technology for waste disposal, and it set a generally uninformed public against the City, so (in my opinion) she could get her name in the papers.  But with a massive Liberal majority set to take the stage this evening, I believe I will vote NDP to, as my girlfriend eleoquently phrased, \"spread the love around\".  Huge majorities, like the one being predicted, aren't always the best way to run a government, and a strong opposition is what democracy is all about.  So.  In answer to your question: I will be voting for NDP candidate for Toronto-Danforth, Marilyn Churley.  You may adjust your votes accordingly."
"But first:  Urggggggggh.  I hate traffic, especially when I'm in a hurry to get somewhere.  Sonsofbitches. Traffic on Reynolda was a friggen' mess!! I guess just 5:00 traffic, I haven't driven on Reynolda Rd. at 5 in forever... it was backed up from Fairlawn into Reynolda Village.  Who knows how long it would have taken me to get home had I not hopped on Silas Creek (going to Mom's that is)  And even still, the left turn lane to get from SC to Reynolda was backed up way past where the turn lane begins, so I went thru the light and did a U turn, then came back and there was a huge backup for the light at Reynolda.  AHHHHHHHHHHHH!  And, of course, I was already pissed because I left training almost an hour and a half later than was planned.    But, on the plus side of that, I finally got to find out some sort of a schedule.  The diabetes camp lady called me today, I guess she must not have gotten one of my emails or messages, because she was like \"OH no, I have you as primary counselor in cabin 2... please let me know if you can't do this by today!!\" (I sent her an email Sunday or Monday telling her that I STILL didn't know anything).  So, this pissed me off, so I finally got in touch with my supervisor, and very nicely was like \"listen, I need to to NOW\".  SO after we finished first aid/CPR, Melissa and I got to go over and meet with her.  And she talked for an hour plus (between interruptions and her just talking).  I was like, all I want to know is my schedule so I can call this poor woman back about camp and get home for my sister's birthday dinner!!!  But, I basically told her \"Look, I've put these people on hold for a month now, waiting to find out a work schedule.  I've been put off and put off as to when I'd find that out, so now they're down to the last second, and I feel like I can't tell them no at this point in time, and I didn't want to say no before now, because that wouldn't have been fair to me if I had and then not had to work at TCH. I can do my day there and come in after that...\"  So, she was like, do you mind coming in for a few hours of \"training\" those nights.  Phew.  So, I'm doing camp 8-4, then 6-9 at TCH.  Lord, I'll be dead.  But, it's worth it to be able to see my camp kiddos.  YAYYYY, I'm so happy, you have no idea how much this has made my week.  I look forward to camp from the time it's over one year, to the start the next. =)    Other than that.. OH! The week after that, I'm doing Tues-Sat 3-11, which will be fabulous for me.  I also found out that I won't be covering 3rd shift, they have their own RRC, which is another sigh of relief!  Hot damn.   I just got back from the Y, and before that, birthday dinner for my sister at Mom & Dad's.  We played a few games of skipbo, all of which my mom won... we think she cheated!  ;-)  I tried to talk my sister (Kathy) into changing her belly button ring, since the ones she (well, actually I) ordered off of ebay came, but she's determined to wait the full 90 days.  PAH I say to that.   And now, the time has come for Nicole to go to sleep.  It's way too late, especually since we have to be there a half an hour earlier tomorrow.  That's going to throw me off all day. We have OSHA shit, which I've heard/seen before, every year I've volunteered at the hospital I've had to sit thru it..  DUH."

"I need to cut caffeine again.  As stated in this  urlLink survey , my sleep requirements went from 8.5 to 5 hours when I quit caffeine.  I wasn't exactly sure if it was the lack of caffeine or the dramatic increase in exercise that was the cause of the change.  Now that I'm still working out just as much (or more) and I'm back on caffeine, my sleep requirements are back at 8.5 hours.  It wouldn't be such a bad thing if I wasn't falling asleep at inopportune moments..."
"Those of you who are my regular readers (both of you) will remember my boisterous post several months back regarding  Syd Schanberg 's  urlLink article  in   The Village Voice   about John Kerry's  alleged  Vietnam POW cover-up.  I'd be remiss if I didn't link out to his  urlLink most recent article  on this subject, proferring the evolved claim that the now unholy alliance of Kerry/Cheney are covering up the real story on Vietnam POW's.  Department of full disclosure: I am not someone who wants John Kerry to lose this election. To my mind, he is clearly a better man and leader than his opponent, who has lost his way. But he is also a man who, like many politicians embedded in government for a long time, has on some occasions allowed his ambition and perhaps his hubris to cloud his judgment. So why, with this piece, have I now written two stories for the Voice (and dozens of other stories elsewhere in the past) about Kerry's role as chair of that committeestories that might cost him some votes? The answer is twofold. First, history and honesty are consequential. A nation can't claim to be a beacon of democracy for the world if the beacon is built on a foundation of lies.  And second, this story has become personally important to me, probably because of my life's arc. I've been in the army, and I've been a war reporter in India and Indochina, where military people have looked out for me. I have learned that duty, honor, country, and band of brothers are not words to be used lightly in political campaigns. I have learned never to confuse soldiers with the policies of the men in a nation's capital who have sent them into war. And I believe that abandoning men who have fought under their nation's flag is a terrible betrayal.  In his Democratic convention speech last week, Kerry said: \"We have it in our power to change the world again. But only if we're true to our idealsand that starts by telling the truth to the American people.\"  I hope John Kerry will turn out to be a different kind of leader. I hope he digs deep and tells us the truth about the band of mennot the \"small number\" they were reduced to in his committee's reportwho were left behind in 1973 in Vietnam. That would truly be a fresh start.   Those of you out there that have a conscience will not want the blood on your hands a vote for Kerry/Edwards  or  Bush/Cheney would bring. Therefore, through sheer elimination, the only safe vote to be cast is for Ralph Nader! Whoooooooo Aaaaaaaah! Let's get ready to rumble!"

"The Dune and Raiders references re: a sandstorm and divine intervention, on the eve of a war with religious undertones, struck me as amusing.  I assume you are joking in interpreting my post as implying that I want a sandstorm to wipe out the US Army.  The irony of Paul's quote re: the sandstorm, on the eve of the current war, is that it could apply to both sides.  That's as far as the implication, such as it is, goes.  It seemed an appropriate attempt at humor, perhaps even commentary, given the title of our blog."
"...now watch this drive.   As I feel that  urlLink Requiem for a Dream  should be required watching for high school children for an great anti-drug campaign, everyone should see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  to get a few more facts on our current White House squatter before we all go voting this November. Excellent documentary and way better than Spider-Fucking-Man 2 (what a waste of money that was). So what I am basically saying is, I just watched Fahrenheit 9/11 and it was great. Go see it, or download it since I guess Moore has no issues with people getting it off the internet. I truly can't see where people can watch this documentary and play off the whole thing like it's all a fabrication.   And what the fuck!?! I just wrote a whole bunch more but it got erased.

"hello again.  i'm doing pretty good with my daily posts huh?  it's cuz i did a lot and i guess i just don't wanna forget it.  that's pretty much why i blog in the first place.  i basically don't talk about what i think about certain things as much as what i do...when i do anything at all.  hehe.    saturday, andy and i went to LA with my aunt and my mom.  we just wanted to check a few places out.  my aunt wanted to go shopping for something she needed while i wanted to look for shoes for the wedding next week.  well, she wanted to go on her own...and it took us a while to find her!!!  geez...it was so freakin' irritating.  and that place was so crowded!  we were also kind of in a rush cuz we were gonna go to my nephew's birthday party with my brother.  eventually, we got home and i had to wrap the gift i got for jason.  the party was at carriage crest park so it wasn't too bad from my parent's house.  so, we got to hang out with my family (dad's side).  we hardly ever get to spend time w/ that side of the family.  basically, i think my mom kind of brain washed me and my brother.  but now that we're older, we are trying on our own to be closer to that side of the family.  after that party, we had another family party to go to.  it was for my aunt and uncle (on my dad's side).  one person was retiring and it was the other person's birthday!  it was pretty cool.  there was a lot of people.  of course, it's always nice to run into family!  =)  one of my  urlLink cousins  from san francisco was also here so we were able to hang out with him.  the party was good...they had a lot of entertainment and got the crowd involved.  they also had a pretty cool center piece.  they had a bowl with a beta fish and on top of that, they had orchids.  basically, the whole thing just looked like a vase with orchids...until you look closer and find the fish.  hehe.  they also had give aways with the small cute martenilli apple ciders with a small glass.  and then they put it in this cute little silver pail.  we kind of took more than what we were supposed to.  oh well...those were left overs anyway.    since we  NEVER  really hang out with the \"de los reyes\" cousins, we decided to do more hanging that saturday night.  michael (the guy from frisco) actually stayed an extra day just so we can all hang out.  so, after the retirement/birthday party, we were gonna meet up to figure out what we were gonna do.  meeting time was 11:30pm.  andy wanted to go home so we can change and walk the dog.  first, we met up with my brother and he drove us to my cousin's house.  we then hopped into the expedition and was off to some bar in hollywood!!!  one other thing to remember...i was the only girl!  6 guys and 1 girl!  it was kinda weird...esp. since i don't really hang out with these guys.    when i was younger, they were the \"bad\" cousins...the bad influences.  and that's why my mom didn't want us to hang out together.  hehe.  anyway, michael met some girl at the party we just came from and she met us at the bar.  we were on our way in but then the security or bouncer (whoever that is) saw how many guys were with us and he just wouldn't let us in.  so, basically that girl decided to take us to another bar that was walking distance.  we walked into an alley that smelled like PEE!  we walked in where there were tables that were filled and then walked into the bar/club area where it was freakin' hot.  it was so crowded in there so we decided to just hang outside.  hehe.  no one drank...we were basically just there for my cousin...that wanted to get hooked up.  hehe.  so, he was the only one inside while the rest of us were just talking outside.  back in the day, some of the cousins that i was with that night were gangsters.  it was actually the first time andy got the chance to really talk to these guys.  andy ended up saying something like...when we first got together and we would see you around, trina would hide because she was scared of you and that you would do something to me!!!  hehe.  i kinda got embarrassed when andy told him that cuz i didn't want him to know that i was scared of him.  but ya, he said that he wouldn't have done anything to andy!  hehe...sounds funny.  but andy got mixed up.  i was kinda scared of my other cousin (who already passed away).  i was scared of him because a long time ago (sometime in junior high) when i wasn't with andy yet, i was walking home from school.  i was walking home with some friends--crystal, leonard, and rafael.  well, they were walking too slow so i decided to just walk ahead of em and go on my merry way HOME!  so, they were walking behind me and those guys decided to just kick some small rocks towards me to get my attention or something.  i guess i was tired  cuz i just felt like ignoring them.  it's not like they were hurting me or anything...we just play around and do stupid stuff.  so, yeah, they knew i was just ignoring them.  as i was walking, i was passing by my cousin's house."

"I did nothing at work yesterday.  I usually am the one looking for things to do, always staying busy.  I figure that I am getting paid to work, so I might as well work.  Yesterday was different.  I did the bare minimum.  I didn't even try to look busy (which is an art form all its own).  The reason for this is that when I called for my schedule on Sunday, the boss answered the phone.  When I asked whether or not I was working the next day, he yelled at me!  \"What's wrong with you?  Janet, It's Sunday in the middle of football!  Call back tomorrow.\" I had been careful not to call during the busy dinner rush.  I didn't realize that watching football was more important than running a restaurant, so yesterday I decided that standing around doing nothing would be acceptable.  I was even hoping to get the Young and the Restless on one of the tv's.  I had five customers all together in the four hours that I worked.  My total read was under $50.00.  I have asked him for more hours.  I wanted to open Mon-Fri.  He has been giving me two or three shifts per week and they are on the lightest days.  I am finally fed up with this job and am looking for another.    The rebellious person in me really wants to get caught doing nothing.  I secretly want to make a scene and walk out the door telling him where he can stick his job.  What have I got to lose?  I've given this a lot of thought.  My leaving would not hurt any of my co-workers - in fact - it would add excitement to their day and if they took over for me they might be lucky enough to make an extra ten bucks.  This is what fantasies are made of!  I doubt I'd have the guts to do it, but then again - ya never know."

No worries, this happens a lot. Then, just as i was finished, i bumper the \"back\" button of my mouse (i have one of those intellimice things). Of course, this means that when i went back to my e-mail, it remembered the address and the subject, and my several hundred word mini thesis into the meaing of life was lost to posterity forever. or at least until i can get enough coffee into me to work up the efoort to retype it all. Funny isn't it, it's harder to type the second time over. It feels like work, rather than typing a letter. Annoying.  Which is probably why i can come straight over here and type without thinking about it, yet am baulking at the thought of typing the mail over again. bizarre."

"KERRY'S ECONOMY   John Kerry laid out some of his plans for the economy yesterday.  He said his plan would created 10,000,000 jobs in his first term with something like 4% unemployment.  That's a nice dream.  It's not impossible, Clinton did create something like 11,000,000 in his first term and get unemployment down to 4.3%.  I hate to say anything good about that piece of crap.  However, while we were having the best economic grown we could imagine there were things going on that would burst that bubble.  CEO's were screwing people over unchecked, terrorists were planning the worst terror event in the history of mankind and \"Bubba\" was getting his jollies off with his interns.  Then in 2001, the dot com bubble burst and oil prices began to climb because of Clinton.  How you may ask is that Clinton's fault.  Read the link below.   And bang, the recession started.  See, I give him something then I take it away.  All is right with the world once again.  Anyway, back on subject.  Anyone want to bet that Kerry's estimated ten million jobs will begin to be revised in the following months.  Bush got blamed for Clinton's recession, and if Kerry wins in November, he'll get the credit for Bush recovery.   Credit:   urlLink Newsmax      KERRY ON THE \"RICH\"     I was reading an article yesterday, sorry I can't remember where it was, and in it Kerry was talking about raising the taxes of the rich.  In Kerry's mind, anyone who makes over $200,000 is rich.  So Kerry wants to raise the taxes of these people.  I wander if he's really sat down and thought about this?  While for most of us $200,000 is a lot.  And maybe making that would put us in the upper class tax bracket.  But, for instance, in NYC, $200,000 would be considered middle class.  It's a little thing called standard of living.  Someone should really raise this to 'Ol Sour Puss.  He says he doesn't want to tax the middle class, but that's exactly what he'll be doing with that $200,000 figure.    The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing"

"Well, I'd like to do anything but that essay.  I think we've had enough Centuries to do well on the test, but I'd like to finish the series later.  Cause like Kolk said, Peter Jennings is one sexy hunk of man.  I'd like to tear into him like Sam and his Sheila (that's Aussie for \"girl\").  Just kidding about all that, but I really enjoyed Sam's lecture today.  He's very intelligent, understands what went on and why, and can relay it to a bunch of high-school kids very effectively which is tough to do.  I think the key is boot camp and that drill instructor that's itching to get out... keeps us on our toes.  The lecture really effected my views about the time period.  It drives me crazy that the era that produced The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, The Rolling Stones, Jimmy Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Who and Miss Clark would also deem it noble to spit on a soldier who risked his life fighting for freedom.  That may sound distorted/cliche (even to the vets), but the troops were there because the government told them to be...the government that feared the domino effect, and that if Asia went down to communism, trade ceases, America chokes on its own success in a ridiculous recession no military might could pull us out of, then the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, WWII, and every other conflict we've participated in under the banner of freedom and democracy would have all been for nought.  It is so prevalent to Iraq... Bush riding terrorism to attack a country that could foster terror... but it makes me think \"what about Saudi Arabia?\"  like, 4/6 or something of the 9/11 bombers were  Saudi.  And what about Palestinian groups like Hamas and Al Aqsa Martyr Brigade?  Are they not also equally important to the war on terror, despite the fact they are attacking Israeli Jews rather than American ones?  Sam's lecture also helped shape my political views.  Kerry fought in Vietnam, won a silver star for valor as he captained a boat in the hottest of zones in the heart of Vietnam, Bush skipped out on the National Guard.  Although military experience does not ensure quality presidency (Grant), Eisenhower seems to have done a job well done.  I also get the impression that being surrounded by death, Kerry might be more hesitant to send in troops, he might carry a higher appreciation for the life of a soldier.  I was going to ask Sam about it, but we ran out of time.    Give me your thoughts on Nam, communism, Sam, or political oppinionism.  Good luck on the test, and good luck to SJClark in Seattle!  Love, Rob"

They aren't informed of political issues, they don't know what is going on in the world.  And, by golly, they should not be.  Just think, if these females started watching the news they would stop taking care of our nation, Under God's children.  In addition to this, every single time the woman has sexual relations [because, you see, the average woman is a whore.  Every good Christian knows that one should only have sex for procreation and one should never  enjoy  it.  That's against God's way.] it's equivalent to her selling her vote.  Because everybody knows that women don't really think, they just latch on to others' opinions.  So if this hypothetical woman was having sexual intercourse with a man out of wedlock [obviously they are Liberals because only Liberals have premarital sex.  this is another instance that the death penalty would come in handy] and he whispered in her ear, \"Oh woman with whom I am fornicating, won't you please vote for that Liberal candidate John Kerry?\" she would do it.  This is not the way to a good democratic system.  In another growing trend, women are getting entirely too uppity lately.  Now they want to kill their babies and get upset when the Good Christians of our nation tell them that this is unacceptable behaviour.  As one of my fellow authors pointed our ina previous post, life - as well as the soul - is formed at conception and if is the worst sin  ever  to take a human life.  These baby killer, anti-life Liberals are just the source of all evil in the world.  Masturbation is also, as a commenter pointed out, \"evil and unnatural\".  When people masturbate it is exactly like killing children.  And everybody knows why the Liberals want to kill children.  Because they are afraid that the children will grow up to be good law-abiding Republican Christians in our United States Under God Our Holy Master of America.  Just another string of examples of why Liberals are the Agents of Lucifer, the Devil and Enemy of our Lord."

"Three more days  before St. Philip's Day.... and here's the meditation and prayer by Venerable Newman...  May 22 Philip's Cheerfulness   Philip welcomed those who consulted him with singular benignity, and received them, though strangers, with as much affection as if he had been a long time expecting them. When he was called upon to be merry, he was merry; when he was called upon to feel sympathy with the distressed, he was equally ready.  Sometimes he left his prayers and went down to sport and banter with young men, and by this sweetness and condescension and playful conversation gained their souls.  He could not bear anyone to be downcast or pensive, because spirituality is always injured by it; but when he saw anyone grave and gloomy, he used to say, 'Be merry.' He had a particular and marked leaning to cheerful persons.  At the same time he was a great enemy to anything like rudeness or foolery; for a buffooning spirit not only does not advance in religion, but roots out even what is already there.   One day he restored cheerfulness to Father Francesco Bernardi, of the Congregation, by simply asking him to run with him, saying, 'Come now, let us have a run together.'  His penitents felt that joy at being in his room that they used to say, Philip's room is not a room, but an earthly Paradise.  To others, to merely stand at the door of his room, without going in, was a release from all their troubles. Others recovered their lost peace of mind by simply looking Philip in the face. To dream of him was enough to comfort many. In a word, Philip was a perpetual refreshment to all those who were in perplexity and sadness.  No one ever saw Philip melancholy; those who went to him always found him with a cheerful and smiling countenance, yet mixed with gravity.  When he was ill he did not so much receive as impart consolation. He was never heard to change his voice, as invalids generally do, but spoke in the same sonorous tone as when he was well. Once, when the physicians had given him over, he said, with the Psalmist, ' Paratus sum et non sum turbatus ' ('I am ready, and am not troubled'). He received Extreme Unction four times, but with the same calm and joyous countenance.  Prayer  Philip, my glorious Advocate, who didst ever follow the precepts and example of the Apostle St. Paul in rejoicing always in all things, gain for me the grace of perfect resignation to God's will, of indifference to matters of this world, and a constant sight of Heaven; so that I may never be disappointed at the Divine providences, never desponding, never sad, never fretful; that my countenance may always be open and cheerful, and my words kind and pleasant, as becomes those who, in whatever state of life they are, have the greatest of all goods, the favour of God and the prospect of eternal bliss.     Meditations and Devotions"
"If letters could blush... I will just come right out and say it, I am not going to Iraq! This morning in order to prepare for leaving all of us Marines recieved our Anthrax and Small Pox vaccinations, as well as constantly being bombarded with \"the importance of being mentally prepared for the worst.\" To top that off we just had a memorial ceromony for two of our fellow Marines from a different Battery who have died in Iraq. A Battery is about 130 people there are normally 5 Batterys in a Battalion thus, 2/11.  So at the COB today the  word was passed that we are now at an operational standdown and are to resume our regular training on Monday. I sincerely want to apologize for anyone who read my last entry, I want you to understand that I was certain we where going, everyone up to my Battalion Commanding Officer CO  thought so. I feel like a real goober I thank you all for your prayers and I am glad to know there is concern for my life and my ministry.  I will say that if my words can help you to realize the seriousness of the situation over there right now I have done some good. Sure we Americans are winning the war. for each Marine, Sailor, or Soldier killed there are about 200 Iraqi's killed.  These are men like myself, yes fighting for a different reason, but none the less more valuable than the choicest diamonds, more beautiful than the most enamoured sunset's. A large part of me was really set on going, I work with some very bellicose individuals who are motivated by the prospect of war. Well, I am happy that I will not go I guess... I should just take things as they come from now on and not say anything till I am on the plane. Through all of this I cancelled my leave to go see my family and go to a good friend of mine's wedding. Told everyone that I would going and now am taking it all back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

"alrighty, so - yesterday was my birthday. i'm twenty fucking three. and i feel old as hell. i worked all day - and it was a nightmare. my dad's partner claimed that he had given me an eighty eight thousand dollar check to send to an insurance company. i knew he didn't give it to me, but when we called the bank it turned out that the check had cleared. i had no idea where it could have gone, and the client who's policy it was supposed to pay for - was being cancelled for non receipt of premium. needless to say- both my boss and my client were ready to kill me. i was about two seconds from a nervous breakdown when julien called my office for the ten thousanth time that day, so i finally picked up. i explained quickly that i couldn't talk (both of the men were sitting right in front of me at the time) - and instead of a quick ok - he starts interrogating me about when i will be able to talk (in a pretty nasty tone i might add). i had no choice but to hang up on him. my boss was already five seconds from ringing my neck and i was five seconds from jumping out a window. well, anyway after a few more hours of hysteria - we found the money. it turned out that my new boss's wife had deposited it into my new company premium account - and had just forgot to pay the company. we overnighted a check to them - and the problem was solved. by then it was six and all i wanted to do was go home, so i did. at around nine thirty - desiree met up with me for some birthday drinks. we ran into some of my old college friends - and then took a drive over to AJ's house to visit. it was pretty fun, and it totally made my day seeing her. lesigh. i am really pissed off at julien, even though it isn't his fault because he didn't know what i was up against - but then again, with him there & me here - he never will know. and i'm fucking tired of the rude emails and one sided bullshit. i feel like i'm being penalized because i don't have time to sit around analyzing other people's actions and writing long winded emails about myself. i hate to say this - but only the word pretensious comes to mind when i think of him lately. he thinks that everything applies to him. everything. and it just doesn't. ughh. i suck. and luckily i'm too busy to care. anyway, i'm at work now - and i'm tired as hell. i hope today goes quickly. i really do. i need some time out like whoa."

The pictures, the tabloids, the lies, and half-truths that surround thier lives as soon as we fall in love with them is sharp double-edged sword for being successful.  But there is something about Ms. Spears bratiness and schizophrenic slut/virign persona that just bugs me to the point where I feel she deserves the incredible public scrutiny that she gets.  Madonna never apologized or complained as much as Ms. Spears has about her sexuality of public screw-ups.  Ms. Spears want us to worship and fantasize about her, while at the same time, allow her to be a child and make mistakes and be absolved of them.   She's not that hot either."

"Photo of the Day for November 30, 2003   --  Old Harper's Mill   urlLink     Photographer:  Julia Mazza  Comments:  This is a fabricated mill at Disney World, Magic Kingdom, in Frontier  Land.  I decided to go for the sepia tone and add a bit of grain to  enhance the \"age\" of the image.  I love antiques and this shot made me  think of things old and long forgotten.  Camera used:  Sony DSC F707  Geo. location:  Orlando, FL  Judge's comments:  Lovely atmosphere. I think the sepia is well chosen and the extra grain makes it look a little older. Well done. Congrats. The fact that the lines are not really straight is not a real problem in this picture, since it is old :-) I like the angle from where you shoot from, maybe I would have left a little more space on the right?"

"urlLink The Christmas Conspiracy  We've all heard of \"conspiracy\" theories of history. Great events in history didn't \"just happen,\" we are told, but they were planned by conspiratorial architects, acting in secret, hiding their true intentions from the ignorant masses, and carried out by dedicated, brainwashed, or fanatical followers. The founding of the Federal Reserve System, the assassinations of both Kennedys, Martin Luther King, and even John Lennon, were all planned beforehand by people in high places, in order to solidify their power. At least some people think so.  Even if all these conspiracy theories are true, they pale in significance compared to the greatest conspiracy of them all: The Christmas Conspiracy.

Maybe I am just imagining it, but I really feel strongly that that is how she thinks and feels.  And well then she checked everyones work before they left class and she was like to me \"Who did this?\" and like I mean yeah Paige helped me a bit but I was the one to do the stuff, and she was like \"this is good work\" but she didn't belive that I did it.  I felt really bad after that.  I mean that is just an example how she underestimates me and like she thinks I can't do anything apparently.  I am getting frustrated again, I am so sick of trying to hard.  Effort I put in is not paying off.  It feels like all my energy is being wasted, and for what.

"Interesting...    What's interesting, you ask?  Having my friends know what \"type\" of guy that I like.  Weird.  Jennifer and Ricky think that a guy they work with (whom they refer to as \"Scruffy Nick\") is the perfect guy for me.  Well, not perfect, but someone who I'd take interest in.  I'm finding this odd.  Especially since Ricky couldn't really TELL me what qualities he thinks I think are important in a guy I'd date.  Anyhow, me and Jennifer went into Toys R Us today to go see Ricky and Druck, and so she could write their schedules down.  It was fun stuff...  I'm not supposed to reveal any details from while we were there... even though I think they're cute.  Okay, so... Jennifer's probably going to go to Warped Tour with me and Melissa... because Amy wants to go to the Paul Oakenfold rave that's going to be here on Tuesday night.  I decided not to go to the rave, because I'd rather use my money that I make tomorrow and Tuesday (from training) to buy t-shirts at the Warped tour AND at DMB... because I'm going to the concert on Saturday with my brother.  :-)  Yay... good times.  Anyhow... that's all for now... we're going to T-3 tonight... :-D  Good stuff."
"Guess I never talked about my CLC (Conversation Language course) English classes. Wow we had a really nice gang there & I was the youngest. (Alright there was just one person younger than me!) I loooooovvvvved being pampered by them! Joking! But really we understand each other & despite the age gap we got along very well. I used to nickname my friends names like p the pampering?; B the beautiful? & even A  anti-woman? or . (I used to be   Philanthropic  !)  After 2 years, we still meet each other sometimes specially with one of my best friends P-the-pampering (great 32 year old guy, chemical engineer) & H-honey (26 year old sweet girl, environmental engineer). Theres this friend of ours M-money minded (31, chemical engineer; I owe my nickname to him!). Well he is really forgetful & must be reminded about gathering every once in an hour so he can show up! (Ah, did I forget to mention he is a flirt? Though once you get to know him it wont bother you!) & he had not showed up for the last tow meetings. Last night I was in math class when he called me out of the blue & left a message. It was not clear & I just could recognize few words:  hey about tomorrow date make it tonight give me a call.?   What on earth was the reason he called? What date? Did I miss something? I just couldnt help feeling tense; the thoughts were pondering on my head while I was calling him.  Hello??  He said surprised! Whats up?? I asked frightened! He paused for a moment & then burst out to laugh & between laughter he tried to explain what was wrong!  You another tonight sms ? was all I could get! At last he managed to breathe & told me?  goodness, I wanted to call someone else but I didnt have the number so I decided to call-back on his sms & it seems I dialed your number instead!?  Can you just imagine me? I was flying off the handle but before I could shout anything, he said:  have you ever been in love??  & I was like huh? He said:  well, you can tell how I feel right now!?   He is lucky I like him or else he had been dead by now!"

"Welcome, December.  Man am I happy this year is almost over.  Hopefully it will mean I am thisclose to beginning grad school and even closer to leaving job x.  It's Monday, and that means the late shift at my crappy job.  Gotta be there at 2:30, so I still have some time.  I haven't mentioned this on here yet, mainly because I don't know what to do about it-my sister in law's father found a job for me.  It's in a private school in Brick as a computer teacher, which will allow me to work 3-4 days a week, with the option to pay into benefits.  The job is mine if I want it, since they really need someone.  My brother and sister-in-law have made their home available to me the days I would work there, so that's great and I wouldn't have to commute over an hour every morning.  Obviously I also want to start grad school, and I don't know the final decision because I have to interview hopefully this week at the school.  Anyway, I wanted to find out the decision before making a decision about the job, because it would be difficult to do both, unless I knew my schedule for work and classes.  I mention the job yesterday to one of my family members, who later in the day tells another family member, and the latter family member decides to attack me and basically question why I would even consider the job.  That really pissed me off because it has nothing to do with this person.  It's my choice to make for something I need to do-work in my field.  I still haven't made up my mind about it and say this, but I'm still questioned because it \"doesn't make sense.\"  I guess I know why I wonder about my confidence so much.  People shoot down my outlooks by overemphasizing the negatives and not even seeing the positives for me.  Anyway, fuck that shit.  Bengals won another awesome game yesterday, shoving it right up Pittburgh's ass.  Next week is the battle for the AFC North.  On a related note, Kim asked me if I thought the Bengals could get to the Super Bowl yesterday.  After initially smiling, I realized that lately in sports, anything is possible.  Remember the year the Pats won the SB, Rob?  Who was in the SB last year?  Oh right, they're both awful this year?  Cuse won the NCAA, the Marlins won the series, the Spurs won the NBA.  Stranger things have happened, but I'm not going to get ahead of myself.  If they made the playoffs, that would be simply amazing in itself."

It was also inspired by  urlLink  a recent entry at MacOSXHints.com .    So what does it do? Basically it allows you to enter search queries like \"s/foobar\" (to search for \"foobar\" on google) or \"s/n/apple\" (to search for \"apple\" on google news) right into the location box of your browser.  Because it's implemented at a system level, it should automatically work in all browsers on your system, unless they are too clever for their own good.   This requires that you are comfortable with a little Netinfo and Apache configuration. If you want to customize the script, you'll need to edit strings in the PHP source.

"I ended up going out to see Amy's show. I'm really glad that I did. Her work is evolving in such interesting ways. She seems much more confident and focused. She is doing  entirely three dimensional pieces now. They are a lot more, I don't know, \"strong\" almost masculine in some way. But still fun. We talked about how she wants to retain simplicity and the punchline element, but of coarse, not be taken as vapid. The joke is the point, but there is more there. I think she will have a strong body of work when she is done. I would really like to see her get big shows after she graduates. Not just because I am her friend either. The work is good. Jen was there too and we went to the Press for a drink and then went to Jen's to have some left over birthday cake. Jen's house is really cute. I knew it would be. So much great stuff. Kristi was out, but I guess she  and Bill had eaten already. That stage design place called me yesterday and made me an offer. I really thought that I had heard the last of them. The offer is so shitty I can't even believe it. It's almost a joke. I was making almost twice as much with no education. I don't know what to do. The low-low wage is supposed to be only until I learn FormZ, but then I need a much higher raise than I think they will be willing to give me. I've turned things down in the past thinking something better would come along, but of coarse nothing did. Now I'm screwed. It would be ok until my loan payments started, but then no way. Part of me just wants to take the training and then quite for something better, but I feel that I can't be that dishonest with them, even if they are screwing me over. I have to call them today.

"Historically, products of human creativity in any form have manifested itself in various levels of seriousness. While, some artists have purported their work for entertainment purposes (read: popular music in any form, be it metal), there have been many others who have sought to channelize the human mind to newer realms of consciousness via a visionary theorization of ideals which may be the core or some kind of a  personal emotive skeleton upon which their art is based. Whether ideology creates art or vice-versa can be best answered as one cross-creates the other.   Sartre and Jeffery archer may both write stories, but it would be criminal negligence on the part of a reader to ignore the finer aspects of a Sartre work and merely absorb its popcorn elements. Such a reader at best can be described as hollow.  With regards to Black Metal as an art, the case is no different. There are various sorts of bands. Whoever feels that the bands they listen to, do not think in a profound manner is simply listening to the wrong bands. A lot of bands have deep ideals and are very well read in the philosophies of Nietzsche, Ezra pound, Schopenhauer etc which is very apparent in their lyrics/interviews. Surely ignoring such aspects of their music is to miss the complete point. But, every consumer has a different level of perception & intelligence. So, it is ludicrous to expect similar levels of understanding by all.  BM espouses a lot of ideals which are very well enumerated in the SRP article already posted here (http://www.anus.com/etc/people/srp/ideas/black_metal.txt ). That is the generic ideology behind it. If certain listeners feel the need the need to kill people and burn churches as a part of accepting the ideology, so be it. BM has been extremely fortunate to have had bands who have led by example. As a nihilist, I wouldnt condemn such acts, but at this stage in my life, to be caught doing them would defeat the very purpose of them. At their very least, such ideals are educative and adopting them takes one closer to being a hyperborean in Nietzschean terms.  So in conclusion, it is unhealthy to assume that ideology is not important. Such stereo-typical, mainstream, hollow thinking has no place in BM or for that matter in any serious music."

"Well I was looking at this site and I realized that I haven't updated in a long time and I wondered why that was.  It wasn't because nothing had happened to me recently because things have happened(I got my drivers liscense and the mederocere 1190 results from taking my psats).  I think the reason I don't update anymore is because no one wants to read the stuff I post anymore.  I mean here we have Evil Rob running away to the ends of the Earth for this debate fetish he has while Simmons keeps obsessing about this unqunchable thirst for 1st place in speech tournaments.  I thought I would go and set up this sweet event on MLK weekend because everyone was complaining about the Youth Renewals of past years.  So everything was all good and the bums I call friends said they were coming.  But then one by one the \"old crew\" bailed out with crappy excuses and just plain lazyness.  This really sucked because there were perfect conditions for this retreat.  I mean there was DDR and no school the next day.  On top of that there were cool games planned and a big screen TV for DDR and watching movies.  I still went and the weekend was pure sweetness but it could have been even better they had come through.  Understandably I was pissed at those bafoons not because they didn't want to do but because they blew me off with fake or stupid excuses that didn't make any sense.  I know they are busy but come on people you gotta look at what your doing.  I can get busy some times but that doesn't stop me from seeing the old crew if they want to do something.    Evil Rob you really have to lay off the debate, it's taking over your life.  I don't really see how you could value cutting cards(not playing cards if anyone actually reads this) above anything else but you seem to want to stay home all the time and do it instead of going anywhere.  I think it just sucks that everyone from SWS is finally seperating after mostly staying together for the 1st half of high school.  I actually have an interview at Mr. Hero tomorrow but I think we can still keep it together man.  If nothing is done I'm gonna fall off of the face of the Earth like Joe Strelnik did.

"This was a beautiful week, misty mornings, crisp evenings, bright sun and chills.

A very lazy weekend, H. and I haven't really been out at all.  There are times when I just need that, get all peopled out and need to just chill.  I guess its one of them.  Saw the archbishop on Conversations with Rowan Williams yesterday evening and thought he was excellent.  How refreshing to have a high level Christian engaged in humble and honest debate with the thinkers of the day about issues that people actually care about.

"i'm smitten with someone so unlikely that i'm embarrassed to admit who.  it's a mad world.  if even /i'm/ too reserved to explain it...  but it's true.  and it's mildly amusing.    it'd be gratifying to explain this to Wally, our fellow 80 year-old lit student.  who asserted his opinion last night than anyone who has slept with more than one person in their life, they're to be referred to as \"primiscuous\".  i'm more than thrilled to create a sex life founded in high shock value to amuse the masses.    another dream of breaking my back and legs (and having my teeth fall out) -- as a result of a soccer match this time.   (no wonder i slept so long)  the night before i dreamt i had caramel in my teeth, and i went at it with a finger.  and my teeth disappeared like caramel.  and if all goes well, i'll complete the cycle of paranoia dreams tonight with a vision of my hair falling out.  it will in twenty years anyway.  i lost my breath about two weeks ago when i was playing with my hair in class.  i was twirling bits of it, and before i knew it i had five to six pieces of hair in my hand.  i went back to check, the base of my scalp, right side (where my mom's hairloss began).  and more came out.  it kept coming.  i still don't have a good explanation of it, what happened.  i don't think i'm really loosing my hair this early on.    possibly it's my own fault for wishing my right foot's ligaments have been magically replaced in the night.  what does it mean when you keep dreaming about your teeth and hair falling out?"
"Yeah, yesterday was one of those days that nothing bad actually happened, it was just that, I don't know, mood, maybe, that makes it kind of a bad day.

Anyway, so he called and helped me with my Chemistry.  So I went to bed happy."
"My dream last night - well, it was interrupted.  My newspaper is now being thrown onto my balcony, since it was stolen from in front of my door last Friday and Saturday.  So anyway - at 5:25 I hear this big thunk that wakes me from my pleasant dream.  I think someone is trying to break into my apartment.  I get up and check my locks, then remember about the paper delivery and assume all is well.  Of course, I can't get back to sleep for a few minutes.  I hate that.  When I do get back to sleep, it is only a half-sleep.  I am somewhat in control of my dreams.  It is strange, because I imagine myself in a thinner body.  Why? I am comfortable with my body-type! Overall, my dreams after that were stranger than normal, because I kept waking up, thinking my alarm was about to go off.  I must say, when my alarm finally did go off, I uttered, \"Finally!\" and got out of bed pretty quick."

"Listening to:  Verve - Bittersweet Symphony ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers - Breaking the Girl ,  Jimmy Eat World - If You Don't, Don't  Talking to: Olivia  I have many topics to cover in this post, and I got something like 1 hours of sleep last night... on my floor, so forgive me if portions don't make much sense.  With that preclude, I'll start with a run-by-run of yesterday and today. After I finished school ( an hour after my last post) I took Melissa home and headed home myself, intent on swiftly cleaning my room and getting ready for that night. In reality, I got sidetracked, and didn't really start cleaning my room until almost two hours later. Close to 3:00 I started removing some stuff from my old car that I wanted to keep so that my dad could get rid of it later that day (it never actually happened, he's now debating doing something else with it). Anyway, that took a while and then I had to go back inside and mess with my annoying DHCP server to get the office computer (and then later Penguin, my Linux box) back on the net. My mom suddenly came in and informed me that I had under half-an-hour until the Beaverton Florist closed, so I got in the car and made my way over the get the corsage. On my way back I was going to stop at Blockbuster on Nimbus and rent the Hudsucker Proxy for the after-party, but at the intersection before it I realized that it would take me an extra 10 minutes minimum to get it, adding in traffic time, so I turned around and headed back home. Before I got in the shower I called Andrew and told him that I would be picking him up at 5:45 instead of 5:30 like originally planned (since it was like, 5:20 right then and I wasn't even home yet. I got home, jumped in the shower, grabbed the fastest car and flew over to his house... then we took like 20 minutes to get back out the door again. I got back to my house at 6:20 (Cam and Kelli got there at 6:10), ran around the house simultaneously changing into my suit, finding invitations and directions and eating a quick snack. Then we all got in the van and went to Adri's house where we picked her and Melissa up, but not without first stopping for pictures etc.   By this time it was about 7:00, and after some minor confusion about names of highways (it's highway 26 to I217 to the 405 to I5, no wait, it's I217 to highway 26 to, no wait...) we were on our way. Once we got downtown, we passed a parking structure and I was thinking about turning in, but then I decided that it would be safe to keep going and see if it was actually the Hilton the next block (I thought it was, but I wasn't sure). Then we got stuck in the valet parking line (which we should have used... it was $6, not upwards of $30 like we'd been told before. finally I got sick of waiting behind parked (literally) cars and cut into the bus lane momentarily. After that we circled around and ended up parking the place that I was going to park in to begin with, but didn't (lol). Oh, I can't go on without mention the weird on a streetcorner a few blocks from the Hilton, we were stopped at a stoplight and all just kinda watching him... he had stopped a couple in the middle of the sidewalk and kept getting in their way as they tried to pass. We couldn't hear what he was saying, but judging by his elaborate gestures and body movements, he was trying to ask them form something. Then as the light turned green and we drove through the interestection, he randomly ran over the the nearest wall and did a backflip off it. The couple took this opportunity to head off the other direction. (lol)  We got in and checked the time... 7:25 - amazing considering traffic and all the other delays. Exploring we went... looking for ways took kill the half-hour+ until the doors opened. We discovered the 23rd floor has a sweet viewing area, and a couple other people (Emily, Rachael T and others) discovered that there was some type of high class ball in the ballrooms (by crashing it... well, just taking the elevators down and walking through the middle of it, but they called it crashing it :) ). Turned out that we were in the first 10 or so people to arrive.   The doors finally opened at I-don't-know-when and we got out raffle tickets etc. and went in. It was really nice, all elegant and stuff, and a 12 (I think...) person jazz band played. We spent the next almost-2 hours sitting, taking pictures, eating and really really wanting to dance. Oh, in regards to dancing, our school's faculty (um, no, just our Principle ... the teacher wanted to dance too) won't allow it because we \"have to be allowing of all denominations\" or something... I wondering what group of people outside of the Amish still consider dancing something to be looked down on... It's sooo stupid. /tangent    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      Once we were done sitting, we... stood. and stood some more. Actually we all went perusing the hotel some more and got our official pictures taken."
"HOLLA ya'll... First off, lemme start by saying that, Sue, if you've got a little boy toy who went to CU, AND was Mr. Frat boy, then CONGRATULATIONS! He's automatically HOT and RICH! Here's the reasoning for this: I don't know how the Greek scene works at other campuses, but here in good ol' Boulder, you only join a Fraternity if  A. you are out of state and don't know anyone. B. you don't have any friends and don't know HOW to make friends in the normal way people do. C. you try to make friends but no one will give you the time of day. D. your older brother, dad, or uncle was also a Tri-Delt, and therefore you're almost expected to continue the family tradition and go Greek, even though you're perfectly normal and have tons of legitimate/genuine friends. (These are people I kinda feel sorry for, but this is still the best category to be in. 2nd best category is A. So I hope Sue's guy fits in A or D.)  Now, on to the logistics of the Greek System at CU... Face it,  you're buying your friends.  just admit it. you can't deny it. everybody knows it. So not only do you have to be loaded to buy your friends, but you also have to be loaded to throw the pimpest parties with the coolest HiDef Flat Panel TVs and Surround sound THX stereos, as well as top-shelf only booze and kegerators, not to mention the \"best\" wine coolers for the ladies (and when i say \"best\" i mean \"tastes like kool-aid,\" yet all these girls get \"so drunk\" from them... riiight.) And this isn't a twice-a-semester scenario... we're talking AT LEAST every weekend, if not every night from Thursday thru Saturday. Oh, and frat guys also have to be loaded to buy those huge ass army-type slingshots so they can fire water balloons and used condoms from their balcony across the street to the RIVAL fraternity who is also having a party, in hopes that all the hot freshmen girls will never go to that house again, and instead come to their house where the parties are bigger, the booze lasts longer, the music is hipper, and the cocks are harder...  Now you might be saying, \"All right, Heather, they're rich. But what about that HOT comment you made earlier?\" Well lemme tell you girls. If you had to buy all your friends, would you really waste your money on unatractive people?? HELL NO! You want to be proud of that loyal allegience to good ole Tri-Delt and uphold the campus rumors that \"Everybody knows that Tri-Delt has the hottest guys! And they're RICH, too! I don't care what it takes-- I'm gonna get one of them to ask me to their Spring Fling in Aspen this year...\"  So to answer your question, Sue, well, I guess I didn't really even address the slut-bag part yet... hmmm. Here's the deal. It's pretty much 50/50. Either he's THAT frat guy, or half his friends are THAT frat guy, and since he lives with them, he just LOOKS like THAT frat guy...  okay, that's a lie. He's a dirty whore.  (Can't blame me for tryin' to make him look good... he IS a fellow Buffalo, afterall...)  Wow! that was a lot of rambling on goin' Greek. And I haven't even STARTED with the sororities in this town! Don't get me wrong! I have tons of friends who do the Greek thing, and they're a lot of fun. They all just fit in the A and D categories, that's all. And they really are all sexy and they really do throw the best parties...  Keep in mind that CU was ranked #4 in the  Major Frat and Sorority Scene  category by the Princeton Review (IU took 3rd -- again, way to go Dena!)... Okay, I PROMISE THIS IS THE LAST PRINCETON REVIEW COMMENT I'LL MAKE!!  Shawna, this is why you need to tranfer to CU!!  Not only are we #1 in everything that means anything, but our X-country team KICKS ASS!!  Seeing that I took too long on the frat topic, i'll spare everyone and save more comments for tomorrow!

"I'm too tired for a really good update but I'll put a little effort forth.  I took today off from the crazy touring.  I went and saw another temple.  It was nice but at this point it really was just another temple.  I then went off to a mega mall shopping complex and watched movies, shopped and at for most of the day.  I saw Van Helsing and The Day After Tomorrow.  I figure I need to get as many movies in now while I can.  Niether was great but I enjoyed both.  The Day After Tomorrow was a bit better in my opinion.  It was really awesome and a bit strange to be at the shopping center.  On one hand it was ultra mondern clean and could have fit into any city in America.  On the other had it was in Bangkok and I was almost the only whitie around.  This is b/c it was a bit off of the touristy path.  I wasn't as comfortable as I would have been if was in Korea but it was great none the less.  I hate the fact that I only know a few words in Thai.  Thai isn't a very pretty language but I wish I could communicate more.  What was really interesting was just seeing the average Thai person doing their thing.  When you're out see stuff it's always people trying to sell you shit or take you somewhere or something like that.  And then at night it's women trying to get you to pay for sex.  A good change of scene for the day.   Last night wasn't as crazy as Saturday but it was fun none the less.  GJ and I went to a club named \"Bed.\"  Yeah I know what you're thinking, that's a pretty lame name for a club.  But then think of it this way.  \"Who are you going to bed with tonight?\"  Unfortunatly my answer is \"I went to bed with Gumi James.\"  But whatever.  This is the premier club in Bangkok where all the high rollers and celebs hang out.  It was pretty posh with a great selection of alcohol.  Gumi was looking for a white belt the whole trip and found a bartender there who had one.  The guy was obviously gay so Gumi put on the English charm and managed to buy it off of him.  Pretty bad ass.  We then went to a place called Nana and shot some pool and then went home.  Ok I'm tired and going to bed.  Check with GJ for full details.  Good night."
"I saw the Mexican in the movie theatre.  Wasnt that an interesting flick? Kinda romantic the way the mexican was created.

Last week was little girls (35 of them, not too bad- I had the youngest and I swear my team was special ed or something... it was horrible) Now this week is boys.  (80 of them! it's nuts- I have the lil ones again... it's ok... we'll see how this goes) that runs 8:30-3 so then I go home have a little break and go right to work monday-thursday.

"FRIDAY! YEAH, FRIDAY! Chris and some of his new friends from the Mandarin Oriental are supposed to go bowling tonight at Chelsea Piers. They have black light bowling at this place. Even the pins glow in the dark! I wish I were going, but alas, I dont think Im invited. Maybe some time soon Cindy, Jackson, Chris and I can go and have some fun!   When you think of New York City, you think about how crowded it is with all of these millions of people, Times Square, cars honking, yellow cabs rushing past, Central Park, city buses and subway trains. As far as city pets are concerned, youd also think most people would stick to the usual house cats and dogs of various sizes. Animals such as a dozen snakes, an alligator or a tiger would seem to be somewhat far-fetched, right? Not so, my friend, no so. But I can at least say that these animals seem to be confined to Harlem or the Upper West Side of Manhattan anyway. Lets just hope they dont find any of these pets in Queens.  In the news: A Swedish tourist tried to smuggle eight baby snakes into Australia. They found four venomous baby king cobras and four baby emerald tree boas strapped to his legs in homemade pouches. The cobras had died during the nine-hour flight, but the boas survived. He had planned to sell the snakes for $3500 in order to fund an eight-day vacation.  OK, flu shot done!

"Like Being Reborn  My doctor diagnosed me with post-viral-inflamatory-something-disease. She gave me a huge bottle of codeine to help me sleep (\"Take only 1 teaspoon. If you take 2, you will sleep for 24 hours. That happened to my mother once. Tee hee.\") and an inhaler and told me not to speak for a few days. Batty pointed out that I can finally relive middle school years, complete with glasses, retainer  and  inhaler. And this time I speak the english! Instead of taking the codeine, I cuddled it and my sleep and you know what..it worked. I have a positive mental attitude and willingness to take on new and exciting challenges. Yarf."

Not really trying, since I'm typing this and listening to music and ignoring work altogether, but that's what weekends are for..hrrr. Yesterday I realized I actually miss the punk, even though we fought all the way to the airport...and all week prior. Still, I have a month to redeem self in the gift-giving department, since this is the first time in 15 years that I had lovely & thoughtful presents to open on Christmas morning (all from him since my family are a bunch of commies) but gave him a book he already owns in exchange.    The evening prior (birthday of Jesus) was spent with his parents and sister and porkchop the cat, at which point I realized what a terrible sucker I am for families and baby pictures and non-boyfriend's old bedrooms that are now antique storage rooms. Not that I'm getting sentimental or changing my mind about anything. It was nice, that's all I'm sayin.   After sending him off on Friday, I spent the weekend in Carmel-by-the-Sea with Alex and Nick and Genny & her family. Will write more about that later."

"I have to work on a paper that is due on Monday.  The topic is my personality type, which is an Idealist.  This is how my personality type is described:   Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible self -- always this quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling, in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry, they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials.  Idealists are rare, making up no more than 8 to 10 percent of the population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their numbers.   Yep, that about sums me up.

"It is taking literally everything I have in me to not drive to his apartment, to not call him, to not beg him to stay.  It's pathetic and it's ridiculous, but that's the way I'm feeling right now.  He leaves today and I won't see him again until early July.  This is the longest we've gone without seeing each other since this whole love affair began.  And I know it will be OK and I know I can't freak out too much and I know he'll be back and I know I'll survive and I know this desperate, aching sadness will get better as the days go by.  And he knows that I'm having a hard time of it, and he's been unbelievably sweet and tender the last couple of days.  But right now my heart is aching, and there's nothing I can really do about that.  Last night was so sweet, though.  We grilled out in the park on my new fabbo grill, and played Trivial Pursuit with the kids.  As soon as they left, I started crying, and he just held me.  We went back to his place and sat on the couch wrapped up in each other and watched  urlLink Ghost World .  And when we went to bed and laid there talking in the dark, arms around each other, it felt like the first night I spent with him, the first night we were together, the first night in his bed and in his arms - that night when we fought off sleep to spend every moment together, because we knew our time together was desperately limited.  And leaving this morning was so hard - so fucking hard - but I had to go to work, and that made it easier.  And I cried a little and hugged him a lot, but I made it.  And now I guess I'm surviving - trying to keep busy - trying to fight back the tears - trying to not talk about it and not think about it, mainly.  And I'll go back to work, and then I'll work tonight, and then I'll take a sleeping pill.  And I'll work tomorrow.  And the next day.  And one by one the days will tick by, and the month will pass, and I will learn how to live without him, and when he comes home it will be good.  But for right now I just need to remember how to be.  And that's really fucking hard."
"The public toilets at Guam's parks are a disgrace. They are disgusting and vile ruins, heavily vandalized and non-functional. It is one of the top complaints of Japanese tourists when they visit the island. Now the Guam Visitors Bureau, the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Guam Superior Court are teaming up with an innovative  urlLink new plan  - sentencing DUI offenders to clean and maintain the toilets. Not a bad idea, punishment and public service combined. I hope this pans out, unlike earlier attempts to 'adopt-a-toilet' that the previous administration touted as a solution to the public restroom debacle."
"I saw glowstick riding his bike today down Vine Street.  He wasn't riding on a sidewalk or anything, it was the grass and he was on a racing bike not a regular bike.  LoL it was hilarious because I beeped at him from my moms car and he almost fell off.  On a more serious note my moms car is a piece of crap and broke down just as I was pulling into GLP.  I smelled antifreeze on Aurora Road and by the time I got into the parking lot it was smoking like crazy.  I called my mom and asked if her car was smoking pot but she said no and called a tow truck.  I went into the park and tried to find my crew members but they werent on any of the rides I am supposed to be training to run.  To make a long story short I walked all the way around the park at least twice and had to cross the causeway even though it had big gaps in it.  Somehow I ended up at the Dominator and had nowhere else to look so I stayed.  After I rode the sweet ride formally know as the Batman: Knight Flight, they let me run it even though I wasnt even supposed to be in that area.  After that Bill Spehn came up and rode it, but only after 3 people smashed him into the seat.  He gave a speech to the crew(and me although he didnt know the difference) about what a great job we were doing and how the ride was named the Dominator because it Dominated the park or something like that.  It was supposed to be inspiring but it was just weird for me because I wasnt really supposed to be there. Well anyway at the end of the night the TL and the ATL of the ride were going to find where I was supposed to be today so I could go to the right place tomorrow but we just ended up talking to Bill Spehn and Andre some more.  Supposedly I am still going to work the Thunderhawk even though the only training I have gotten so far was on the Dominator.    I got to that POS car at like 830 and there was a tow truck there waiting.  The thing had a top speed of only 60 MPH and didnt even go that fast.  By the time I got home it was already 930, about an hour ago.  I guess I cant talk about anything after that because after that is now.  What Im doing right now is typing up this trip report/blog update while Im supposed to be reading Animal Farm.  Its actually a good book and Im going to go now.  But before I leave, Ill leak a little inside info: Villain has new trims added on that section that seemed to be built for them and Dominator(FKAB:KF) will be running 3 trains all the time now.  Retracking has taken place or is taking place on all wooden rides and the Xflight train was still in pieces last time I checked.  The new music is AWESOME and the management seems to be competent.  My crew is pretty cool(when I can find them)  and Bill Spehn should run for President of the U.S.  I have homework to do.  $$$ Zima"

"I spent some of the day in the back.  At one point, I wandered up front to see if there were alot of customers up front.  There wasn't, but I noticed a contract sitting there for a lawn edger that had been rented an hour earlier to be returned in another hour by a name & address I recognized, her house is kittycorner to the one next to ours.  I made sure I was up front when I knew she'd be returning it.  I recognized her as soon as she walked in the door.  I'd mentioned to I. that I knew her when I saw the bill.  So when J.R. came in, I. said out loud for her to hear \"There's your neighbor back with the lawn edger.  Your former neighbor anyway.\"  J.R. glanced at me, but was trying to figure out what I. was talking about.  I knew she didn't recognize me at that point.  I had to tell her I'm one of G.'s daughters, the middle one.  That her daughter used to come over all the time.  Then she asked me was I C.'s or her younger son's age.  I told her \"my younger sister L. is C's age\"  I'm the middle daughter.  She finally started to remember.  I. told her I'd seen her name & address on the contract & recognized her.  J.R. said that yes she still lives in the same house.  I wasn't sure if she knew about why mother sold the house, so I told her that she had after Grampa died & moved to the place up north.  She asked me where was it & I told her Grayling.  She said that was quite a ways up.  I told her not really that far & that C had gone with us one year.  I could tell she vaguely remembered that, then she said \"Oh yeah, I do remember that.\"  She asked me how long I've been working there, I told her 17 years, but normally I'm at the Dearborn Heights store.  She said \"WOW 17 years? Wow that's a long time.\"  (yeah, tell me).  Then she told me that C is married, has a 4 year old daughter & lives in Oxford.  I didn't get any info on S, I got the impression she had to get going, plus we were starting to get busy again (as was happening all day).  We did our great seeing you & I'll tell the others I saw you thing, then she left.  She was quite energetic, almost jumpy.  That also reminded me of yesterday, I was at Dbn & when one of the guys got back from their deliveries, he told me they were in my old neighborhood (they delivered some stuff to a house on Fox).  (He knew because in the past, stuff in that area came up, like what stores used to be called & stuff, that's a whole other story).  Anyway, he was surprised that there are still some dirt roads over there.  I told him, yeah like Norfolk.  He said yes they were on Norfolk.  They drove up to Fox from Beech Daly.  He mimicked bouncing around from potholes.  I laughed.  I told him I think they left it a dirt road because many of the cross streets are the 2-way stops & the potholes act as speed bumps otherwise people go zooming thru there too fast.  (Ok, I don't know how true it is).  I also told him I remember the busses went up Norfolk & every one used to crowd the back of the bus cuz it was fun being bounced all over the place (I do remember kids used to do that for that reason).  I'm in the Livonia store again tomorrow."
"I am really fucking high right now.  What a beautiful day boys and girls!  After getting really depressed last night, I went to bed around 11:30.  The depression mixed with the sedatives I had snorted made me pretty sleepy I suppose, and besides that I just didn't want to be awake any longer.  After being excited all week about A coming home, the incredible letdown that occurred just made me want to end the day as soon as possible.  I knew he was coming home last night, and I was totally planning on seeing him (of course).  He called me at around 8pm or so to say \"hey,   just left San Francisco so they shouldn't be here for about 30 minutes, and C [his friend who he went on the trip with] is in the shower, so I have a little time to see you.\"  I was completely insulted at this - I'm not important enough to have my own time?  I have to be hidden from his \"real friends\" and squeezed in miniature time slots between his other plans?  Fuck that dude.  I told him no, I didn't want to see him like that, it made me feel really shitty and unimportant.  (This is weird btw, since I usually let him walk all over me.)  I wanted to see him when I wouldn't have a ten minute time limit and he wouldn't have to rush out and pretend he wasn't just with me.  \"What the fuck??  I'm offering to come see your ass and you're going to bitch about it?  Fuck that.  You know what?  Fuck you!\"  I'm sure he continued along those lines, but at that point I hung up.  Fuck him for talking to me like that - I did absolutely nothing to warrant that kind of response, and I'm not going to sit on the phone and listen to him behave like that.  Besides that, I didn't even say anything wrong, it seems pretty logical to me.  He was apparently extremely offended that I didn't want to drop everything and see him for seven minutes and 23 seconds.  So, I did some random stuff around my place and went to bed.  I cried and cried, and eventually fell asleep."

"Among the many discussions about Clinton's book, 'My Life' that has been aired 'ad nauseum', there was one that caught my attention. A republican party representative mentioned that this was good for the republicans because it reminds them of Clinton's antics and would energize the party to make sure there isn't another democratic chance of repeating them. But, I say, it's one of the all time great party strategies for the democratic party, and we republicans better be re-energized, or Kerry just may squeeze through! Think about it. Clinton, right or wrong, was a VERY popular president and a LOT of republicans supported him. Especially when Ken Starr's fiasco did a lot towards alienating a LOT of us. So, what better way to ENERGIZE the failing democratic party but to bring forth their golden boy, bring him front and center, while quietly playing Kerry's campaign ads all over tv, radio and the internet? Thus, intentionally but sublimely suggesting to all, but especially the democrats, that Kerry can be like Clinton and do well as president. Tieing them together in the psyche and put into the voters minds that a vote for Kerry, is a vote for Clinton and that the choice will bring back the glory of the Clinton era to the democratic party! Oh boy!! We certainly do NOT need a repeat of Clinton, and we sure don't want Wishy-Washy Kerry at our nation's helm! Don't be fooled or lulled into thinking that most can see Kerry for the wimp he is and that there's no way he will win. They (the democrats) are very determined to put Kerry there and us republicans and those who care about our nation MUST be ever diligent in our campaign to get out the word that Kerry isn't healthy for the USA and he shouldn't be elected to head it as our commander-in-chief! (Shuddering at the thought of that). Be ENERGIZED republicans and make sure to pass on the word about defeating Kerry, make sure YOU vote in November and make sure all of your republican friends do too, even if you have to drive them there yourself. It's your civil duty.... as well as a constitutional right.... so excersize it!  And to you die hard democrats who are hell bent on getting Kerry in, a message from the republican quarter....your campaign strategy STILL WON'T HELP elect fence straddler, goes where the wind blows, wishy washy Kerry for US President!"
"Great joke from  urlLink Burning Bush :  Robot Bartender  A popular bar had a new robotic bartender installed. A fellow came in for a drink and the robot asked him, \"What's your IQ?\" The man replied, \"150.\"   So the robot proceeded to make conversation about Quantum physics, string theory, atomic chemistry, and so on. The man listened intently and thought, \"This is really cool.\"  The man decided to test the robot. He walked out of the bar, turned around, and came back in for another drink.   Again, the robot asked him, \"What's your IQ?\" The man responded, \"100.\" So the robot started talking about football, baseball, and so on. The man thought to himself, \"Wow, this is really cool.\"   The man went out and came back in a third time. As before, the robot asked him, \"What's your IQ?\" The man replied, \"50.\"   The robot then said, \"So, you gonna vote for Bush again?\""

"Adam questions if its ok to react differently to people based purely on their physical appearance.&nbsp; what he says is: &nbsp;  \"Everyone makes instant personality assessments of people when they meet them, and I have found that my personality assessments are accurate surprisingly frequently. Part of this is that I will react to an attractive person different from an ugly person, rendering my personality assessment a self-fulfilling prophecy; but part of it is that personality really does often correlate with appearance. \"  And then goes into a lengthy justification of why its OK to judge people based entirely on physicality. in summary he say a few things: 1) being attractive takes work, and I like people who work at things. 2) a silly genetics-leads-to-good-personality argument 3) attractive people have confidence 4) unattractive people tend to have self-defensive personality traits. &nbsp; to be fair, read his entire post, and not just the taglines i've given him.&nbsp; go  urlLink Here , now.&nbsp; back? ok good. now we can proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; Upfront, i think 1-4 are, in various degrees, based on flawed assumptions.&nbsp; First of all, the core problem with Uni's view is that it assumes that because people tend to judge based on pure appearance that they  SHOULD  do so.&nbsp; All four of those arguments fall away if you accept that it is in someway wrong to, as Kierkagaard (or was it Dick Van Patten) said, \"label me, and negate me.\" (thank you Wayne's World.)&nbsp; and here's a few reasons why this might be the case. &nbsp; it may be trite but beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&nbsp; How many conversations have you had about \"is X guy/girl you know attractive.\"&nbsp; how many times do people have vastly different opinions about that.&nbsp; A few examples:&nbsp; Ally McBeal was considered to be very attractive, but many found her skeletor-esqely hideous.&nbsp; Many other people find Roseanne Bar to be disgustingly unattractive, yet Tom Arnold found her hot enough to produce children with.&nbsp; It would seem wierd, then, to base some sort of judgement of personality on such a subjective thing.&nbsp; Do people's personalities change based on who is looking at them?&nbsp; that would seem wierd.&nbsp; To put it more simply, &nbsp;many attractive people are assholes.&nbsp; many attractive people are quite nice.&nbsp; many unattractive people are assholes.&nbsp; many unattractive people are quite nice.&nbsp; its hard to judge how a person would react to their own physicality-- and their reactant personality traits.  &nbsp; well, that throws out 2,3, and 4. &nbsp; so let's deal with #1.&nbsp; good looking people, according to Adam, tend to be the type of person who puts effort into things, and therefore, are nice, or good people, or some other term of endearment.&nbsp; let's examine what, exactly, Adam says: &nbsp;   Part of it is that attractiveness takes work, and it requires a certain kind of personality to put the time and effort into being attractive. Only a certain type of person will go and lift weights, and lifting weights makes you attractive, so in that sense, one would expect attractiveness and personality to correlate. But body shape is not the only component of beauty - in fact, I'd say a considerable portion of attractiveness is purely innate. Even controlling for body image, I think personality and attractiveness often go hand in hand   Still, &nbsp;it might well be the case that the type of work that goes into body image makes someone's personality LESS good: more vainity, more ego, more narciscism-- its true that those are qualities that many of my good friends possess, but one could see how being a vain, egoistic self-aggrandizing ego queen might turn some people off. &nbsp; I guess, in summary, that I would say the same thing i say about racism: If you look around in this world, you'll see more assholes than a turkish customs agent. so why hate someone based on their skin, when if you take 5 min to get to know them, you'll find so many much better reasons to hate them. &nbsp;"
"I'm suddenly depressed. Really, really depressed. I don't want to do anything, I don't want to get out of bed, I can't see any reason to live. It hit me like a truck all of a sudden last night and it hasn't let up. I am at a loss for what to do. I thought the damned antidepressants were supposed to keep this from happening? I've been taking them every morning like clockwork. Why have they suddenly stopped working? Or is it something else entirely? What am I doing wrong?  It sucks that this happened right on the heels of my declaring myself a compulsive shopper and figuring out a plan of action to deal with it. I hate having all of my mental/emotional maladies rear their very ugly heads at once.  And I hate that I have to sit through four hours of TCFC meetings this morning feeling like this. Yuck.

"The job interview went very well. The only draw back is that the pay is very low, half of what I was making before I quit my job. After taxes and daycare I would only be making about twenty bucks a week. Sheeesh, I almost spend that in make up and hair spray alone when I am working.  So Allison and I spent the afternoon baking some sweets for Dad. We made yellow cake with chocolate frosting just covered  in rainbow sprinkles( mom's fav) and fudge brownies. Our house smells so good right now. I would insert a picture right here,  but I still have not found my computer cord for the camera.

"Yesterday was much fun.  Except for the morning where my mother abandoned me at the emergency room to have my foot chopped open, so that she could make her hair appointment.  Then after the sketchy doctor cut open my foot, and patched it back up and what not, I call my sister to see where she is, but she's lost.  So me and my numb foot take a walk down the street to try and find the sister, but did I mention it was about 2 degrees out? Then as we are trying to find eachother on the phone, a van packed full of guys drives by, honks and presses themselves up against the window waving.  But finally my sister found me, and my still numb, and now cold foot got in the car and returned home.  After that, the day was fabulous.  Bren and I visited George, and he got us really cute neckalces (thanks George!) then we went to Wendys and came back and Taylor joined us, then Claire and Taylor convinced George to see Harry Potter so we all took a trip and saw it.  Harry was just as hot as he was the first time I saw it.  Taylor still wants Ron (I just don't see it) and Bren has affectionate feelings for Oliver Wood.  Unfortunately, George was not a fan.  Maybe when Hermione grows up he'll start enjoying it a little more.  Then we stopped at Dunkin Donuts (no Bren, not Duncan Doughnuts hahahahaha) and got some yummies.  After that we came back to my house and watched some of Contact.  It was enjoyable.  Today I woke up, showered, went to Nicks to have lunch with him and Katie, then we watched Spiderman and now I am home again.  Isn't that exciting? Well thats about it kids...I'm off to entertain myself :o)   *~Now I've got a peace of mind, there's just no better way.  And if I should die tonight, that would be alright.

I am going to try to get a guestbook on here pretty soon, but use it more as a comment board on the poetry rather than just a regular guestbook.  Also, I probably don't have to say this to any of you, but just in case... Many of my poems are very personal and relate to pretty sensitive issues going on in my life, so if I have given you this address, that means I trust you not to spread them around or tell other people anything about me that these poems might reveal. but like I said, I don't think any of you would actually do that intentionally :) alright, thats all ~love~ em"

"Hey Jesseca, read the bold shit from left to right for a special message... [and oh yes, I know every single person that reads this is going to read what the bold font says. even when i only gave Jesseca permission to do so, assholes...]  Oh my god I miss Jesseca... I  don't know why, but all day I have had an extreme longing to be  w ith, or see, or t a lk to her. It was n 't so bad un t il recently, but it's really strong like right now, and  y es it sucks. I really wish I c o uld see her tommorow, since it's Valentines Day and all, b u t I won't get my hopes up on that one. She's g r ounded, I know,  b ut her m o m  has  to make an exception tommorow, right?  D   on't count out the possibility. Ma y be I can go over there or something. I don't know, it's kind of a pipe dream, but I sure hope so.  I have a little perdicament here. I have been reading a bunch of awesome blogs for the last hour or so, and they were really funny, revealing, and most of all, inspiring. So after reading all this i'm feeling very inspired and want to write something. Something long, engaging, funny and fun. The problem is it's really late and I still have to take a shower, and I have to go to bed sometime because I have school tommorow. I need to choose whether to stay up and write, or go to bed and be awake for school tommorow. My first idea is to just say to hell with school and stay up, something I normally wouldn't do (well actually I probably would, but you know what I mean), but since it's Friday tommorow I don't think it matters whether i'm awake in class or not. I think that's kind of fucked up though because I should probably be trying to do good tommorow in order to have some padding for when I don't do shit next week. In the end I don't think this decision will matter much in the grand scheme of things, and my mind has wandered off to thoughts of Jesseca again, making me lose my place in my thought process that was helping me decipher what the hell I was talking about, so i'm done talking about this shit.  I want a digital camera more than anyone. I think it would be so freakin badass to have one, I can't even start to explain how much fun I would have with it. Maybe I am just an egomaniac, but I love taking pictures of myself. The fun doesn't stop with snapshots of me, I can also take pictures of everyone, and everything, else. Did I mention that digital cameras give you the ability to look at the pictures like you would on a computer monitor, arrange them however you like, delete the bad ones, organize them to your liking, and bring them up on your computer and put them on the internet or show your friends. That is so awesome man, I envy everyone who has one of these things. If anyone were to buy me one of these I would be overjoyed and that would be the coolest thing anyone has done for me, ever (well maybe not but i'm trying to be enthusiastic here). So come on my friends and help me out, buy me a digital camera for no reason, you will go to heaven for it. If anyone seriously does this it better be a Sony or I will yell at you, because I am really picky about that sort of thing. Mainly because that's the only kind that will plug into my computer, you know how that goes...  Man I don't have much else to say, I tried pretty hard to write something cool but i'm sorry i'm just like zoned out and stuff. There was this really cool analogy that I was gonna put on here. The best and most creative analogy i've ever heard in my life actually, so it sucks that it kind of went with a picture, and I can't put pictures on this shit. Did I mention that I didn't do a bunch of homework that I was supposed to do tonight? Well yeah it's true... and that's too bad because i'm going to sleep now."

One day, the tiny little lady went to her tiny little job at the tiny little store, while everyone else went out to see the tiny little matrix without her.

I had a few jello shots and chatted with a funny gay guy from high school. I am assuming he is gay b/c my gaydar was registering off the charts and then he mentioned going to UC later. He then said, oh I am not gay but then opened up when I said going to UC seemed like it would be fun and that I always wanted to see the drag show. He then talked about how he always goes there and gave me a little wink. I tihnk we were on the same page there. So we exchanged numbers and I now have a funny little gay buddy. Jenn will love him!

"My hands feel dry and my hand cream is all the way downstairs. You know when I was talking about sexuality and all that, and it didn't make much sense, of course not he was still here. But now I can talk about it a lot more freely and I think that I  have to get it off my chest before I explode. I am one of those people that love pleasure and love touch and think the whole experience is a sensual discovery and an expression on how much you fucking want that other person. I am not alone in this  belief and I'm not the only one who likes sex for that reason. But godamn it; I am sick of being selfish and waaay over conscious about the whole thing. I am sick to death of thinking only about myself getting off...what about him? I mean I am  such a guy when it comes to sex, lazy and inconsiderate, like I just believe he can do it all on his own. I have turned myself off like a mental handicap on a lot of occasions just because I am afraid. .I am so tired of being afraid like some sort of paranoia filled cloud is consistently blurring my vision. This is hard for me, okay this whole relationship...it's two people...not one...it's so hard, so very hard. Because although its fucking great now, I know that if I let go it will be so much better. I am a realist yet an idealist and there is a part of me that says...what if he isn't the one? What if there is  someone out there that can do all this for you without you doing any work? See how that can fuck me up? I mean I hate that godamn voice, the ever present neurotic weak side of me. The ugly side. But you know I'm blowing this up so out of proportion, because it all it takes is thinking...and feeling freely. Do I love him? I care about him very much...but I don't know myself enough to trust someone else with my soul, it's just not ready yet, this society has just about squeezed all hope from me, it's going to take much more than saying \"I love you\" to blow all this apart and to find that fucking assurance in the belief that I am worth it. So what do I do? I called him today and he was out with JDan and well, okay. Talked to his mother and asked her to give him a message for him to meet me at 9pm tomorrow night. I am wearing his shirt right now and I miss him so much. Why am I such a fucking fuck up? Because I'm an artist? Been said that I have to stop thinking about it and enjoy it, just take that ride with no fear. I kiss him and I can feel myself crying inside because it feels so good it couldn't possibly be true, like the ever  present little masochist, can't be happy so let's be numb."

"\"Worthy to Receive the Lamb\"  From the  urlLink Archdiocese of Atlanta site :   As bishops, we have the obligation to teach and guide the Catholic Faithful whom we shepherd in the Body of Christ. A fundamental teaching of our Church is respect for the sacred gift of life. This teaching flows from the Natural Law and from Divine Revelation.  Life is a gift bestowed upon us by God, a truth underscored by the commandment: \"You shall not kill\" (Deut 5: 17 ). The Old Testament also teaches us that human life in the womb is precious to God: \"...I formed you in the womb...\" (Jer 1: 5). The right to life is a value \"which no individual, no majority and no State can ever create, modify or destroy, but must only acknowledge, respect and promote\" (Pope John Paul II, Evangelium vitae, 71a). A law, therefore, which legitimizes the direct killing of innocent human beings through abortion is intrinsically unjust, since it is directly opposed to the natural law, to God's revealed commandments, and to the consequent right of every individual to possess life, from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death.  Catholics in political life have the responsibility to exemplify in their public service this teaching of the Church, and to work for the protection of all innocent life. There can be no contradiction between the values bestowed by Baptism and the Catholic Faith, and the public expression of those values. Catholic public officials who consistently support abortion on demand are cooperating with evil in a public manner. By supporting pro-abortion legislation they participate in manifest grave sin, a condition which excludes them from admission to Holy Communion as long as they persist in the pro-abortion stance (cf. Canon 915)."
"Well folks, today a miracle happened.  Thats right- Im updating my blog!!  Its been over a month since I updated it, and due to the multiple requests to update it again, Ive decided its about time.  Or maybe Im just fed up with everybody telling me to write in it  So anyways, theres no way I can recap on everything Ive done since my last update, sooooo.. Ill just make a generalized statement that life is still rather boring and the majority of what I do is hang out at Collins house (which is actually a lot of fun).  Christmas was super fantabulous- I got tons of clothes, a few DVDs, aaaaand a bunch of other stuff that I dont feel like typing out right now.  The grandparents were here, so that was fun.

"People annoy me...the older I get, the more introverted I become.  I am really starting to believe it is because I am so easily annoyed with people...  case in point:  I have a friend that is getting a divorce.  She decided she didn't want to be married anymore, she wants to live the single life.  Mind you, she just moved back in 9months ago (she had lived a year of separation with her hubby).  I'm not trying to judge you but what do you mean you want to live the single life?  She has fooled around on her hubby, she had a guy waiting in the wings for her...just say, I want to explore these other options.    Anyway...this new guy tells her he will call, tells her they will do lunch, etc and just doesn't follow through.  9 times out of 10, he's not following through.  Now, she wants to piss and moan that he isn't following through (oh yeah, he has a wife and a baby too--though, I think they are separated, but not divorcing).  Finally, I casually suggested that she should just write him off.  I asked her why was she so drawn to him, they have only gone out half a dozen times.  She asked me what I meant...to which I responded, \"My little sis has taught me a lot about dating, should I ever be out there again.  If the guy doesn't treat you right, if he doesn't act like he should, or if the chemistry isn't there, cut him loose.  Don't beat yourself up about it, it is simply two people that are not compatible with each other.\"  Which should be common sense, but I know for a lot of girls (myself being one of them) it really isn't...our emotions take over and the rational side of our brain goes on vacation.  It's not that easy...is what she responds with.  I agree, if you aren't used to that, it isn't easy but it is the right thing.  So she says \"why do you think I'm so drawn to him?\"  Okay...lesson, if you ask me my opinion, I will be 150% honest with you....I try very hard to deliver it tactfully but I can't make any promises, therefore, if you don't want complete honesty, DON'T ASK!  To which I responded, I don't know if this is true, but from what I have seen, you seem to like the falling in love part and the new infatuation...but once that part of a relationship is over you seem to check out too.  Yeah, I'm sure you can imagine, she didn't like that so much but she said, You're right.  I never thought of it like that before but it is true.  Dude, I'm really not out to be right...I just don't understand why you must bitch about something you are completely bringing on yourself.  SOOOOO...she goes into how she and one of our friend's ex-husbands are talking and she thinks he likes her...this is the SAME friend who dumped her best friend because she started dating her ex-husband.  She is actually contemplating what she should do!  She was the one who brings up, I don't want to be like C and steal someone's ex but what should I do?  Is this really a question???  You just answered yourself!  DON'T!  You couldn't handle it so why would you risk a friendship expecting someone else to???  Lordy...stupidity bugs me...  Other than that...CP and I are planning a trip to Chi-town for the end of the month.  Nothing major, just some shopping, some clubbing, and then home again.  We'll stay over one night but I am so excited!  K may come with us, though she gets very intimidated by large cities...so I don't know if she will chicken out or not.  I so need a day away from everything...only a few more weeks!!!"

"My favorite part from T2 was the writing etched into the picnic table in the desert  \"There is no fate but what we make\"  It suggests that we have control over our lives.  We have the ability to make it what we want to make it.... be it that we are smart, clever, ???. They say the human brain only uses 10% of its potential.  What do we do with the other 90%?  We use it as a hat rack.  Maybe we don't use it at all.  But what if there was something productive we could do with all that extra grey matter.  What if it is that part of our brain that holds the potential we have of NOT being a victim to our surroundings and people with more money or political power?  So becoming theSpinner was an attempted to turn on a few extra brain cells.  Becoming my own spinner of my fate instead of some old woman I have never met sitting in front of a loom without my name on it."

"urlLink One Hand Clapping :  Tom Brokaw has the audacity to impart the Leftist lies on the Iraqi head of state in a lecturing tone.     Brokaw: I know that you and others like you are grateful for the liberation of Iraq. But can't you understand why many Americans feel that so many young men and women have died here for purposes other than protecting the United States?  Allawi: We know that this is an extension to what has happened in New York. And - the war have been taken out to Iraq by the same terrorists. Saddam was a potential friend and partner and natural ally of terrorism.  Brokaw: Prime minister, I'm surprised that you would make the connection between 9/11 and the war in Iraq. The 9/11 commission in America says there is no evidence of a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein and those terrorists of al-Qaida.  Allawi: No. I believe very strongly that Saddam had relations with al-Qaida. And these relations started in Sudan. ...\"   Maybe Tom should have taken the time to actually read the 9/11 commission report.     With al Qaeda as its foundation, Bin Ladin sought to build a broader Islamic army that also included terrorist groups from Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Oman, Tunisia, Jordan,   Iraq,   Lebanon, Morocco, Somalia and Eritrea. Not all groups from these states agreed to join,  but at least one from each did.  With a multinational council intended to promote  common gooals, coordinate targeting and authorize asset sharing for terrorist operations,  this Islamic force represented a new level of collaboration among diverse terrorist groups.   Why does this lie that the 9/11 Commission found no link persist in the media in the face of numerous statements in the report that al-Qaeda and Saddam WERE cooperating.  They had not yet launched an attack on the US, but they were in the process of sharing resources and capabilities.  That is clearly in the report.  The Left seems to be hung up again on the lack of connection between 9/11 and Saddam.    Does the standard of defending ourselves still require us to accept the first blow from our enemy?  Were we to wait until Saddam and al-Qaeda got their act together and killed a few thousand Americans before the Iraqi was was justified?  The Left still seems to want to treat Terror as a law enforcement problem, confined to waiting for a crime before we can take action.  Can we afford this?"

It's a community decision, I think, made up by a consensus (or barring that, a majority) of the people. Problem: the 2000 census reported 281,421,906 people in the United States. How the hell are we supposed to set up a community standard that works for 281 million people?  We don't. It's impossible. The country's too big.

"Allright so this is a long one but very important:    More Work for Less Pay      President Bush's  assault on overtime pay continues . His administration has already issued rules  scheduled to take effect August 23  that will strip overtime pay from an estimated  6 million workers . Yesterday in Ohio, President Bush touted two new proposals which go by the deceptively appealing names \"flex time\" and \"comp time.\" Bush claims that the proposals are motivated by a concern for working mothers and other members of the work force with demanding schedules. In reality, the proposals would allow businesses to have their employees work more than 40 hours a week without getting paid overtime.        CURRENT LAW ALREADY ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY:  Current law does not prevent an employee and an employer from negotiating a schedule where the employee works, for example, 50 hours one week and 30 hours the next. The employer is simply required to  pay time-and-a-half for the extra 10 hours  in the first week. \"Comp time\" would allow the employee to \"choose\" to substitute the extra pay for additional time off. It opens the door for employers to pressure workers to \"accept time off instead of overtime pay.\" Even absent explicit pressure, employers would be free to \"channel overtime work to those who were willing to take comp time.\"  Moreover, \"employees would have to take their earned time off when it suits their employer rather than when it suited the employee.\"        FLEXTIME MEANS NO COMPENSATION AT ALL FOR LONGER HOURS:  Bush's other proposal  \"flex time\", would allow employers to set work schedules on an 80-hour, two-week period. This is essentially a mechanism for employers to schedule overtime without providing any overtime compensation. Like comp time, it promotes  irregular work weeks  that may reduce workers' income or reduce leisure time.        EMPLOYEES FINANCE INTEREST-FREE LOAN TO EMPLOYER:  Comp time proposals that have been introduced in Congress would permit employers \"to deny use of comp time for a year or more.\" The effect would be that employers would \" receive an interest-free loan from their employees , while workers who gave up premium pay would get shortchanged by devalued banked comp time.\" If some of the banked comp time hours end up unused, \"the employees are likely to wind up working longer annual hours than they would have without a comp time program.\" AFL-CIO President John Sweeney explains, \"comp time is 'paid leave' only in the sense that it is  'paid for' by the workers' own lost overtime earning , minus interest.        LESS EXPENSIVE OVERTIME MEANS MORE OVERTIME:  Allowing the substitution of time off for overtime will \"lower the marginal cost of scheduling overtime\" and \"intensif[y] the economic incentives for employers to  lengthen the number of overtime hours scheduled per week .\" The result would be longer and more unpredictable work weeks  a development that is anything but \"family friendly.\"        PUBLIC SECTOR IS NOT A GOOD MODEL:  Advocates of comp time note that it has been available for some time within the public sector. But that doesn't mean it is a good idea for the private sector. Specifically, \"there is a real danger of losing comp time accruals [in the private sector] in the event of a  business failure .\" For example, In 2000  when the economy was still booming  550,000 U.S. businesses closed. Also, \"the relative absence of unions in the private sector leaves employees vulnerable to employer abuse.\" Finally, since private sector employees are not required to provide any paid leave for vacations at all there is nothing than would \"prevent an employer from reducing or eliminating the paid leave it provides now and substituting comp time in its place.\""

A light so bright that brings severe contrast to his place of slumber. Black and white is the color of the room as the shadows stand at attention. Forever do they wait for him. There is no color in this world. He stares at the lamp but thinks nothing at all. He achieves what is unattainable for all.   He is on the outside looking in.

"Hi, ladies!  I managed to catch Rick on with Linda Vester today and also saw him on Studio B.  Rick looked good, despite the fact that he was wearing the black sweater again.  Lol!   We may not get to see any more Rick-Shep moments until after Christmas, as Shep mentioned taking some time off.    Todd Connor was also on Studio B and may be shown again on Fox Report.  Todd was reporting on charges that some juvenile offenders had been abused and was wearing a black leather jacket and a black (I think) shirt underneath.  He looked good, also.    Tidbits:  It was mentioned on Studio B that some Fox people had been invited to a party at the White House tonight.    On Fox&Friends today, it was revealed that Bret Baier became engaged the night before Thanksgiving.  The bride-to-be is named Amy and lives in Chicago.  Also on F&F this week, James Rosen mentioned that he had been on a leave of absence in order to work on his \"masterpiece.\"  Sunday's coverage of Saddam's capture resulted in Fox News being ranked Number 11 in cable ratings for the week ending Dec. 14.  (This includes all of the entertainment and sports channels.)    Although reluctant to mention that \"other\" news channel favorably, I have to recommend that those of you interested in the immigration issue should watch Lou Dobbs on CNN.  He's doing a series called \"Broken Borders\" and is astonishingly blunt in discussing immigration, far more so than either Fox or MSNBC.  He scolded a CNN reporter about referrring to illegal aliens as \"immigrants\" and told an immigration proponent who said that \"Only citizens should be allowed to vote, BUT...\" that \"but\" shouldn't even be a part of the sentence.  BTW, did any of you know that a UCLA study has recommended that non-citizens should be allowed to vote in Ca.?  In my area, Lou Dobbs' show is shown in the early evening and repeated later at night, so you wouldn't necessarily have to choose between watching his show and watching Fox programming."
"It was harder than I had imagined getting across the field to the castle. Especially because I kept looking over my shoulder, hoping that the man would reappear.  Youll never get anywhere that way,? a voice said in front of me. I whirled around quickly and the castle seemed to have jumped in front of me.  What do you mean?? I asked searching for the body that belonged to the voice. A tall gangly man, with a black oversized jacket over a gray vest and white shirt, was slouching on the steps. His top hat was pulled down low over his shaggy hair, and his pants were baggy as well. A silver pocket watch chain hung at his side.  Well, you keep looking back; you want to go forward right?? He unfolded himself and pulled the hat off his head. Two long tan rabbit ears sprung up, and I saw a matching pair of whiskers attached to a rabbits nose. I gasped and took a step backwards.  Oh, so you do want to go that way. Well if youre going to walk in that direction, turn around and do it. Walking backwards only confuses you.?  No, I dont, I meanI do want to go that way,? I pointed to the castle, its just, you startled me,? he pulled out is watch, glanced at it, and put it away.  Hmm,? he sighed lazily putting his hat back onto his head. Did I scare you then?? He leaned closer and sneered. Well youre going to be late.?  Late! For what?? I said leaning away from him.  The masquerade, the ball, the dance,? he was spinning around dancing with imaginary partners. The he latched onto me, Every young woman comes in disguise to kiss the prince and marry him.? He spun me in a circle and caught a hold of me again. He dipped me, his face coming perilously close to mine. Isnt that why youre here?? He righted me, stood back, and bowed. Me lady.?  I, um, I dunno. I guess so? I stammered, flustered, and blushing. Was it the prince Id come to kiss?  Well then, madam, go. Go kiss your prince. Go win his heart, and the hearts of the people in your kingdom,? he pulled open the door, and motioned for me to enter. Hurry down to the ball, but first,? he stopped me before I could leave. I turned to face him anxiously. Dont forget your mask!? He pointed to a basket full of them next to the door and I stooped to find one. I grabbed a black feathered one, and began to walk down the hallway."

I feel so fake, automatic, and Robot-ish. Everyone says how pretty they think I am, how proud of me they are...  How I did a wonderful job singing and/or reading and/or distributing communion.  Its so nice to hear people say all these lovely things about me, but after a while it almost seems like they're just saying that, that they don't really mean it.  Everyone thinks I'm so good.   Even  people I only talk to on the internet every couple of weeks or so will ask me questions like \"You probably hate alcohol don't you\" and when I ask them why they would say something like that they say, \"You just don't seem like the kind of person to do stuff like that.\"  I don't understand how they know that.  I can't exactly beam my charming smile at people over the internet...  Sometimes I just wish I could go away for a year or so, and leave all these expectations of me behind..."
"Whoa...didn't realize that it had been so long since I've done anything with this site.  Well, that's gonna change right now.  As you can tell, I've changed the site template to something a bit easier on the eyes, and the changes aren't gonna stop there.  I'm going to be working on shifting the current CF.Net archive to the new schema, updating and adding material where necessary...  ...but that's just the beginning.  I've got a few more ideas for possible future projects, so just keep your eyes on this page.  Oh, and check out CF.Net's sister site,  urlLink Spectator Mode  for random blogging goodness. :D"
"Hello all here I am on my spring break trying to catch up on school work. I have a Calc test on Monday that I need to do well on and a paper due soon after for my philosophy class. I've also picked up an extra two shifts at work so that I can get a nice sized paycheck this pay period. Susan's folks are coming into town on Thursday so she's stressed out cleaning and making everything ready for their visit. She also has a test on Thursday in her bio class which sucks because she's going to be working all day at O'neils on St. Patty's day wed so she'll be tired and stressed on Thursday when her test and parents arrive. I wish I could do more to help her. In other news we're going to go spend a weekend up in Colorado on April 10th and 11th( my birthday)  which is going to be very fun."
"Calamari 2.0   Find that local international grocery (Global Foods, 421 N Kirkwood Rd. Kirkwood, MO 63122) stocks pre cut frozen squid rings. Thank god. None of that gut, clean and slice crap from last year. Same international grocery also stocks english fish and chip batter. Totally cool.  A few weeks later a houseguest is over and suggests you make squid. Go to independent bookstore. Go down the street to another international grocery and fail to find cocktail sauce, but leave with crab chips, wasabi peas, and chinese biscuits. Stop at another grocery for a lemon and cocktail sauce.   Defrost squid in large plastic collander. Liberally squeeze half a lemon over it. Roll in flour and dip in the batter you've made according to the directions. Drop about 1- pieces at a time into pot of boiling canola (hint: boiling olive oil smokes and is gross. Canola works great). You have 2 MINUTES MAX to do this, any longer and you're going to end up with batter dipped Goodyear. Drain on layers of paper towels and eat with more lemon and cocktail sauce."
"These last couple of days have been slow and really boring lately. For some reason ppl dont want funnel cakes. Ive also seen a total of 5 ppl i know at the fair and one of them was twice. So whats with this? Do ppl not like to go the fair during the summer or are ppl just coming when im not there? Well anyway if you plan to come, dont come on the 10th and only go to a funnel cake place owned by FUNNEL CAKE EXPRESS. Theres another place that sells them for a higher price and even though they have the same name as us, they're company name is Funnel cake West. The rest of this week i have no plans what so ever so if you want to do something with me or you want to hang out then give me a ring. AND make sure you call me if you plan to be at the fair anytime soon so i can see a fimiliar face.    LOOKING AHEAD....for my next post i  hope to have a pic of me and my family during our cruise in Mexico. Its very very interesting so i hope you enjoy it.  Prayers: -Church is looking for a building  -Brother's SATs -Dad's work -My eagle project -My Great Uncle -New SOS council -SOS youth group (new visitors)  P.S If you can pray for any of these things then that would be GREAT"
"Hello friends.  I am growing a beard. Why? Why not? It seems perfectly appropriate. I may shave my head too. We'll see.  When did drinking become so important? When I watch a western I see guys guzzle liquor and it's cool. Like in \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" when John Wayne storms into the bar and guzzles shot after shot of whiskey, then just takes the bottle and leaves. Thats cool. But thats also a movie. And in real life John Wayne wasn't so cool.  And in real life when I find myself sitting at my office(Cafe Balcony on Rochester adjacent to the intersection of santa monica boulevard and Centinela- stop in anytime) I often overhear young people, my age or younger or older perhaps, discussing the amount they drink, what they drink and how often they drink it. This isn't cool. It's not uncool though- because it's dangerous. It's just sad.  It's sad because drinking in and of itself isn't much of a thing to do. Drinking is okay when you got laid off. It's okay when you won the lottery. It's okay when you got dumped, or stood up. It's okay if it's the office christmas party. It's okay if you just shot liberty valance but Jimmy Stewart's gonna take the credit AND get the girl. And it's even okay if you're out some night having a good time. But it's not okay every night. It's not okay most nights. It's not okay every time you wanna have fun. Or most times. Or even half the times.  Because there is a lot more to life and being alive than liquor. I ain't no preacher, and I ain't getttin on no high horse. What you do with your liver is your buisness. All I'm tryin' to say is that drinking, in an of itself, is no particular achievment. It's nothng to be proud of. Anybody can do it-- and most peeps do. And anybody can do it A LOT. and, again sadly, most peeps do.   So to wrap this up for ya, don't go wandering around talking abnout how you drank a bottle of malibu last night at Jimmy's house. Or how in your prime you could do century club five nights in a row. And don't go braggin' about spending nights shooting tequila and writing down how many shots you took because you watched a Hugh Jackman flick.   I'm sure every being has something, one special thing, that they can do. And while there is, according to this world view, somebody who got the 'drinking' skill as their one special thing, it's probably not you, and it's probably not a skill you want for your one special thing anyway. Whoever is the guy who has the one special thing of drinking is probably not even reading this and probably doesn't talk about how cool he is for drinking so much. He's a very sad guy, in all liklihood, and he's probably somwhere drinking right now. As I write this, and as you read it and at all times.   Point is folks, drinking is fun. But it's no special achievement by any means. I don't care who does it and how much, but I just get down when i hear people talking about how good they are at or how much they can drink. I want to grab that person and shake them and say, 'SNAP OUT OF IT DAMNIT! YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS!'  If you can't tell already I find this blog to be very psychologically revealing of myself. Now that it's all written and done with. Perhaps I'll go rewatch \"Tapestry\" on Season 6.  Godspeed to you all.  -Gfunk"

I dont really care about spelling or grammatical errors. I dont kno who will read this but i'm sure someone will find it amusing. I dont really have any friends cuz they all seem to stab me in the back. but i refuse to right about stupid shit like the damn war thats 'going on'.   although i will talk about the student council elections that are on May 15th...anyone from HHS...vote for me Junior Class Secretary...  so anyways, I have this huge MG(multi-genre) shit due in 2 different classes and is totally stressing me out...and a science project that the parents will not leave the freak ALONE! thats it for 2nite, just wanted to test this new stuff out...  oh yea, gotta get up at 6 tomorrow for an awesomely fun track meet!"
"I am taking a break from my current routine.  I am in the process of revamping my approach, and I think I'll have it finalized by this evening.  Using my husband's routine was creating results, but I was losing interest.  Having three days to sit around, doing nothing, was getting me back into my pre-exercise days.  I am also kicking around the idea of getting back into martial arts classes.  Unfortunately, the form that I used to practice, Wing Chun, is not taught in Omaha.  *pout*  So, I will have to choose something else.  But, I think that it would be great to get myself back into the group learning environment.  Plus, I just really enjoyed learning about the thought processes behind the art.  Food journal will resume shortly.  It is much the same as it has been previously, but with smaller portions, more fruit when I can find it, and less coffee.  Additionally, I am attempting to eat more often, but in smaller quantities.  I have read, and heard, that eating more often not only helps one avoid overeating, but also helps to keep blood sugar constant.  Keeping blood sugar constant is supposed to tell the body that food is plentiful, therefore, it does not have to create fat for reserve energy.  Well, we will see, now won't we?"
"Goodnight CHICAGO...    glimpses from closing night     Claire, the lady in the box office I won't see for awhile. The houseboards, marquee and lobby displays disassembled. The final audience buzzing with excitement, wanting the elusive magic of the final performance. The dressing rooms, once homey and lived-in, now cluttered and torn apart as we prepare to take our things home. The sign-in sheet on the callboard now full. Clips, reviews, photos and various sign-up sheets tattered, worn at the edges. Props: umbrellas, newspapers, old-fashioned cameras holding on for one last performance. Spike tape and glow tape just as it was during tech...some of it replaced after heavy traffic. The orchestra warming-up. The techies prepping the sets, lights and special effects. Listening to the Overture one last time. Seeing each cast member take the stage for their final show. Standing alone behind the center upstage door awaiting my entrance  Is everybody here!? Is everybody ready!? . Seeing Roxy's bowler hat lower from the flies during \"Roxy.\" Watching everyone watching everyone else...taking inventory of the faces and the experience so we won't forget any of it. Being surprised at just how emotional our final show is for me. Standing with Pam (Roxy) on the empty courtroom set and saying \"Well, I guess that's it for you and me...\" and really feeling my own subtext. Singing my final note, slamming the center upstage door...and losing my shit. Standing with the company stage left hugging and kissing each other during \"Nowadays.\" Taking my final bow. Restoring my costumes and props to their cases and boxes. Cleaning my area of the dressing room. Watching the set disassembled and removed. Saying goodbye to everyone one last time. Being told goodbye one last time. Walking out past the marquee...already advertising the next show. Without a trace...CHICAGO was gone. As I walked away from the theater, and into the center of town, I realized I'll miss Billy Flynn most of all. So, if you see him...give him my regards. I'll miss ya, pal.    It's just a noisy hall where there's a nightly brawl      and all that jazz ..."

"One thing I've recently (i.e. within the last 5 years) realized is that I used to live my life, and still do but to a lesser extent, in a state of competition.  How am I doing compared to the rest of the world?  I still do that, as I said, to a lesser extent.  I worry how some peopel do compared to me, mainly because I generally think that yes, I AM better than some people.  That I've worked hard and done my share of suffering also factors into the question.  But the truth of the matter is this--  I am who I am, and that's all that's important.   So what if I'm not the golden boy at work, or if I'm not rich, or if person X is doing better than me?  I am who I am, and I'm pretty happy with that.   Positive message for the day =P"

"Mmmm....listening to FF Music at the moment...orchestra style....could listen to this and bask in memories all day...that's weird...memories about a video game...hmmm...  Wal-Mart would be THE coolest place for a happening partyhouse/club.  Man, me and Fifer went there at like 10:30 and still couldn't find a parking space.  Not to mention when Olivia and I went there at midnight and were hit on by some guys...hmm but it would be so cool...I would definitely hang out on the vegetable aisle....hahahahahahahah NOT.  That would be the sex aisle.  And I don't want to have sex in a Wal-Mart.  Right, well, anyway...  So I got Amy's baby shower gift which was like $40 and then two dvds in the sale bin so I spent about $50.  The checkout guy was funny.  His nametag had flipped over so that his entire name was showing and then it flipped back over to where it showed only his first name and I noticed that his last name was Strange, and that happens to be the last name of this other guy I know.  So I was all, \"Hey, are you related to Gary Strange?\" and he was like all confused looking and looked down at his nametag to see if I knew his last name from that but it was on the first name side so he was like, \"My last name is Strange.\" and I was like, \"Really?\" and he was like, \"Yeah, but I don't know a Gary Strange.  That is weird.\"  and then me, like the big dork I am, replied with, \"Yeah, it is  strange .\"  ahahahahahahaaa..ha..........hah..heh.  cough.  I am pretty stupid, I think.  So yeah, I got Joan of Arc and A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Yay.  Then we went to Barnes and Noble and I found me an FFX strategy guide that I glanced at before leaving.  Psh, it didn't even tell me anything I couldn't have figured out on my own.  Oh well.    Then we were gonna go to 7-11....hahaha but I was distracted by the elementary school with their sprinkler system on.  So I had to go crash that party.    Well, we then went to 7-11 but they DIDN'T HAVE ANY SLURPEES (sign that the world is ending #4) and so I just bought some starbursts.  Yummm those were good.  And then I dropped Fifer back off at her house.  Well, I wanted to listen to my Moulin Rouge soundtrack that I had burned customized to my song preferences at the beginning of the summer because I had never gotten to listen to that the whole way through in my car.  It is so cool too, it has all the good songs from the first and second soundtrack, but none of the crappy ones from either.  ANYway, I put it in and realized that it was a completely different mix of songs I had made and I just labeled the CDs wrong.  But it was all good because it was a mix of songs that I liked because they helped me think about life.  So they was an inspirational hour of my life that I spent driving aimlessly around the Dallas/Fort Worth/Arlington/Mansfield area.  Every song...was amazing.  It was a variety too.  Saliva, Jimmy Eat World, Gershwin, Nicole Kidman, John Williams, and Hans Zimmer to name a few... I still think my theme song of the summer is \"My Sundown\" by Jimmy Eat World.    I wanna be so much more than this.  Today I went to church to say goodbye to all of those friends of mine...I will definitely miss Leah, Jon, and Sarah.  Then I went to Amy's baby shower, at which I saw more people to say goodbye to.  Then I went and visited Olivia up at her work and she hooked me up with a free ticket to see Freddy vs. Jason so I did that.  And then I just came back here and am chilling.  My brother cooked us dinner tonight!  I am so proud of him.  And not just because he cooked dinner, but because I think he has really become a great guy.  He has matured a lot over the past few years I think.  I know it is too late to turn back and I know that I do not really want to turn back, but sometimes I have moments where I seriously think that I am stupid for leaving everyone.  Hmm...  Well, I am off to eat dinner.  -Lisa"
"Either I've developed some newfound confidence that comes from not wearing glasses anymore or else I'm suddenly, randomly, the hottest man on the planet -- but I've gotten more attention in the three weeks since my LASIK than I've gotten in the three years I've lived here.  Woo-hoo!  For example: Sunday night I went to Sidetrack after rehearsal and left with TWO phone numbers from two very hot men -- both of whom approached  me!   And then I had an awesome date with one of them Monday night.  We chatted about everything and nothing for three hours in his funky loft condo and then went for a trashy dinner at Red Lobster.  (And then I woke up this morning all bloated and garlic-y, but I guess it's better than waking up all pregnant and bleeding.)    I get the feeling he likes me a lot more than I like him, though.  And over the course of our five hours together, he all but dropped the J-bomb on me three or four times.  And in my superficial overview of his place, I didn't see one magazine or newspaper or any related periodical indicating a love of reading or following the news.  But he's kind and decent and successful and intelligent and he has a strong sense of family, and our evening just flew by.

"Blah blah.  Well, I've got some time before I go out (like...an hour)...so I figured I would ramble a bit.  I've made my summer reading list, it's pretty RAD, BITCHES! Yeah. Okay. I suck. I'm a sucky loser.  I've almost finished  House of Leaves , then I'll probably get  Hamlet , and  Cry, The Beloved Country  out of the way for school. I've got to read  Candide  for french, and I'm gonna read  Carnets  by Saint-Exupery as well. Just to keep caught up in the language stuff. Then I figure I'll read  The Picture of Dorian Gray , because well, it sounds good. And I picked out Bob Woodward's  Shadow , because lets face it, keeping a head into politics is vital if you don't want to be labeled 'ignorant', and Woodward is the god of current events/political journalism. I wanted to pick up  All The President's Men  instead, but they didn't have it. So I settled.  So that covers it. I guess I'll be pretty busy...I'm gonna have to balance the whole work/play/party thing.  But umm...right now...I'd say it's time for the partying to commence. I've been reading all day.  Okay, crazies, I'm out for the night."

Ok, so Im here sitting in my OPIM (Operational Information Management) course typing this.  Thats right, I said Im in class.  For the previous 45 minutes Ive been surfing the web, going to Yahoo to play the Crossword, talking to people online with AIM, and I have to wonder why in fact I am here.  And I dont mean in this classroom on a chilly yet sunny day in Storrs.  I mean why the hell am I in college if academics are not doing it for me.  Ive been here at the Good Ol U of C for 4 years  Thats a long time.  I have taken classes that are to expand? my mind and the way I think.  Thats a bunch of bullshit.  I can barely remember what I learned last semester let alone what I learned my freshman year.  So why go to college?  Whats the point?  People are the reason.  Case in point: I am a shy guy. (Anyone who sends me a message about Super Mario Bros 2 is getting a sample of my new product, Shut the F up Soda.   And I also just proved how much of a geek I am, whatever.) At least I was when I was 17 and new meat in the grinder that is UConn.  And now, 4 years later, I am still that shy guy. Hes hidden out there somewhere.  He comes out for parties and things like that.  I met 250 people on my first day of college.  250 people that I know who would otherwise be nonexistent to me and never would have had the chance to change my life forever.  Im a band geek because of it, but wow, was it the gateway to forever change who I was.  I dont care about classes, classes mean nothing.  Its a bunch of buzz worded bullshit thats crammed down your throat so when I go to get a job I can say, Ooh, look at my shiny business degree!?  Fuck.  I hope I never get to be that much of an asshole that I sit back in a comfy chair and talk about buzzwords in the intricate dance that is a job interview.  Tango well enough, you get the job.  Miss a step and you die.  I cant wait to be done with this farce.  Time to bounce, class is over and so must I be.  Ill be back to finish this.  Ok, so now Im at work.  Standing-by in case anything goes to hell on the job.  And Im still in Storrs, and its Friday.  Where was I? So much as happened in 2 days.  Oh yeah, why college is necessary. People are the reason why one goes to college.  90% of the people I have known have been from college.  Thats a large ass percentage of my friends.  Now I love my high school friends with everything, so its not that the 10% of my friends who are from home are worth any less, the fact that one would consider worth in friendship is kind of odd in my own opinion.  My friends are the ones who have kept me going when Im down, when Im REALLY down, and are ones that share in my glowing accomplishments.  Ten years down the line I am not going to care what I learned in college, what I am going to care about are those people who helped to shape my life in the years that I was the most malleable.  Now, to play Devils Advocate, I am not saying that college is just a social zone where you are expected to learn nothing and just meet people.  If you wanted that, just go to a frat party, there will be tons of good people worth meeting there.  (Maybe sarcasm, perhaps not. I will be considered indifferent on this issue.  I dont really think that frats and sororities are what cause people to act like jerks, bitches, or assholes.  People are the way they are.  It does however seem that traits are magnified sometimes when you join one of those organizations.  I speak from the inside looking out folks.)  Classes do serve a good purpose, to teach you HOW to learn, not what to learn.  Im taking a course in Dante right now, and I wouldnt have a damn clue where I would start with the reading of that thing, its complex shit. Im glad I have a teacher that has somewhat of a clue how to steer my understanding of the piece.  Other classes I have taken, like my OPIM 204 class, is a complete waste of my time. Its a classroom regurgiatation of what I have been learning on the job for the past 5 years.  In a year, I graduate from UConn.  What will I remember?  Will I remember that one course that changed my life? No.  Am I going to care about what I took my fifth semester? No. I can barely remember what I took my fifth semester now!  What I can and will remember is the people that helped change my life."

Also a theme for my list of current crushes. *wink*wink*  The halloween party was a blast.  Ching and I got the \"hot sisters\" compliment a couple of times.  Woohoo!  I got acrylic nails put on for the occasion, and I still haven't cut 'em yet.  To be honest, I really actually like them.  It makes it really hard to hit the right keys on the keyboard though.  Ugh!

"Ok so I'm becoming more and more impressed with Blogger's capabilities. Now I can have titles. Nifty :) Problem is I can't think of a title first before the blog - usually. Oh well, minor inconvenience.   So I'm getting sucked further and further into my fixation on Kiefer Sutherland. *sigh* I don't know what my damn problem is. Maybe it's just hormones. I blame the internet mostly. Before I got online, I'd see a flick and think 'oh yeah, he's hot.' and that would be the end of it. Maybe I'd have a sex dream or two involving said actor deciding he couldn't live without me *grin* and well, that would pretty much be the end of it. These days, I have far too much access to archived interviews, trailers, movie updates, interviews other obsessed fans made of when they appeared on Leno and dumped online to feed my craving. I waste ages trying to delve a little bit into what makes these guys tick.  Believe me I feel incredibly silly talking about this. I don't like to let people see how weird I am but I've got a blog and I'm gonna use it. I want this to be a no-holds-barred journal so there you go. I... am a weirdo. Anyway, getting back to Kiefer... I can't sum him up. I, of course, don't know him as a person and never will really, all I know about him is his work and the articles I've read. No way does that give me any true insight to what he, or any other celeb is like as a plain old human being. So I think a lot of my attraction to him is based on the parts he's played. Same with the other 2 or 3 actors I get like this about. I like stories about tortured individuals involved in some kind of struggle - mental or physical. Kiefer happens to play a lot of those. I find it fascinating that in one film he can exude pure evil like in Eye for an Eye where he plays a rapist and in another film play an abused young man who's so traumatised that he can't speak as in 'Trapped in Silence'. Amazing. Maybe I simply admire the talent. Maybe I'm just letting my inner teenie out for a stroll. It's hard to say.  I'm sitting here writing this, feeling like such a dweeb and yet also feeling like I have to explain why I'm a dweeb.  Actually I've been wondering who the next little obsession was going to be. That's how it works you see, I get hooked on one from seeing a film and then stupid me gets online and starts reading about the actor, or at least about the film that got me hooked and it just snowballs from there. With Kiefer it was a little different as I'd actually been a fan of his since Lost Boys. In fact, I can remember when that came out because my friends and I were so chuffed that it was filmed in nearby Santa Cruz. Half of the opening scenes were like seeing my home on the big screen :) Anyway at the time I was big on vampires and into Anne Rice goth-y stuff, so naturally I was completely *phwoar* over Kiefer's vampire. He was very yum.   So now that he's on 24, I find myself back into Kiefer-dom. It's not a bad place to be really :)  Right so.. Summing up, I am really just a hormonal teenager with the hots for some actor.  I am just a heartbeat away from creating a fansite, and I have Jack Bauer as my desktop theme. *sigh*"

"Every now and then the zeitgeist opens it's coat to show you the goods. When you see the wares Mr. Z is plying you say, \"of course! I knew you would eventually have some of that!\"   Ostensibly this is a long article about niche publishing -- but you know when you read it, it's you more than that. This is a culture clash. The brains against the brauns. It's the revenge of the nerds. And the most beautiful thing is that it is about foreigners using the most American of marketing axioms (charge more b/c the product is more \"exclusive\" -- it isn't for \"everyone\" -- HA -- which means EVERYONE who is anyone, will HAVE to have it on their coffee table!) as the weapon of choice to achieve success in the American market. It works for restaurants, it will work in publishing.  ______________________________________________  THE BRITISH ARE COMING -- AGAIN.   THE LAUNCH OF A U.S. EDITION OF THE UNABASHEDLY LIBERAL GUARDIAN MAY BE JUST WHAT THE BUSH-WHACKED U.S. PRESS NEEDS.  By Michael Wolff (New York, metro.com)  It was a daylong conference about the medias role in the Iraq war, sponsored by the Guardian newspaper and held in its archive centera newly refurbished building with cafacross the street from the Guardians main building on Farringdon Road in London.  Everything about the conference seemed foreignnot just the self-critical nature of the conversation, but the bad air-conditioning and stifling temperature of the room. I tried to imagine such an event in New York or Washingtonpicking at the fresh scab of how we had covered the warand what news organization would sponsor it. Of course, the real subject herewhich so much of the U.S. media had closed ranks aroundwas the U.S. itself. That most massive of Bigfoots. Indeed, more and more, the foreign media had a distinct journalistic advantage over the U.S. media: Foreigners could go after the central story and openly dispute the Bush-administration message, whereas U.S. journalists were tied to the party line by a complicated emotional, social, political, and corporate etiquette.  In this respectas a robust counterpoint to the American mediathe Guardian (to which I sometimes contribute) had had a very good war. It became an almost-fashionable read on select U.S. campuses and in certain American liberal circles. Traffic on its Website, which has had a steadily growing American audience, climbed dramatically during the war. The electronic Guardian was the alternative pressif you were looking for one.  Still, when, during a coffee break, Alan Rusbridger, the Guardians editor, said to me, in a most offhanded way, Were coming to America, I assumed he was talking about a personal visit.  Well, lets definitely get together, I politely said.  No, he said. Were bringing the Guardian to America. Were going to publish an American version.  It struck me first thateven given the Guardians campus chic-nessthe U.S. has never been less receptive to the European point of view than it is now. By any measure, to be successful in the U.S. news business is to be staunch, patriotic, defensive. Its Fox or bust. And it struck me even more forcefully that beyond the difficulties of liberalness, the prospects for literate mediathe Guardian being a writers paperwere, as everybody knew, nil.  Then, during the next break in the conference, Rusbridger took me across the street to his office and showed me the prototype for the new American Guardian. Its tentative form is as a weekly magazine, quite unlike any other weekly magazine that has been started in the U.S. in the past generation. Not only is it about politics (Rusbridger is looking to launch in the winter to cover the presidential-primary season), but the magazinemeant to be 60 percent derived from the Guardian itself, with the rest to come from American contributorshas a great deal of text unbroken by design elements. This is almost an extreme notion. Quite the antithesis of what virtually every publishing professional would tell you is the key to popular and profitable publishinghaving less to read, not more. Even with the Guardians signature sans-serif face, it looks like an old-fashioned magazine. Polemical. Written. Excessive. Contentious. Even long-winded.  This was either radically wrongheaded, or so forcefully and stylishly counterintuitiveand unexpectedthat I found myself thinking, light-headedly, that it might define a turnaround in American publishing.  Bear with me. There is something here.  First, its important to understand the anomalous nature of the Guardian itself.  There may not be anything else quite like it in commercial publishing anywhere. The Guardian is the fruit of a legal trust whose sole purpose is the perpetuation of the Guardian."
"Aaahhh! Is there no one out there who actually wants to help us with our bloody coursework?!?!"
"When my brother came to visit me in San Jose last month, we took a little trip to the drugstore on the corner, where he found the best pair of sunglasses he'd ever seen.  They hung lonely and faded on a revolving rack that had clearly been displaying the same glasses for at least 19 years.  The pair he zeroed in on were fluorescent yellowfaded fluorescent yellowwith a strange sort of ventilation device on the sides.  They supported a fortress of lens that would prevent even the most determined ray of light from penetrating through to the wearers eyes.  But the best feature, by far, was a faded tag attached to the center of the frames that read Future Vision in a 1980s Tron-like computer font.  He had to have them.  Hey bro, you  did  just have a birthday, I said.  Put them in my cart.  This was before I flipped over the Future Vision tag and discovered that inflation had somehow retroactively caught up with these babies: their  original  price tag read $12.99.  We nearly peed our pants laughing.  For those?! Kris asked.  Youve got to be kidding.  We went back and forth.  I said I didnt mind paying that, that I just wanted to see him happy in the way that only these beauties could make him.  He thought $4.00, the price on a nearby (albeit less exciting) pair was more like it.  So we took both pairs to the front of the store and pleaded our case.  The counter man looked at me, looked at my brother, looked and the glasses, looked at my brother, and said, $4.00.  Kris beamed a victory smile and then turned to take the comparison glasses back to their rack.  The counter man mused in his thick Middle Eastern accent, He looks very happy now.  You have no idea, I said.  Kris wore those glasses for the weekend and then carefully packed them up for his return to Hollywood, where people apparently share his aesthetic sensibilities.  Hes been standing on street corners and had cars pull over, their drivers asking where they could get a pair just like his.  Sorry, he says, youll have to go to San Jose.  Recently, he was wearing his Future Visions on a street in Hollywood when a homeless man approached him and asked him if Kris wanted to buy the sunglasses  he  had to offer.  It seems the man knew his audience because my bro snatched up this pair (brown monster shades with the word \"sport\" written in gold on the side), which immediately took top billing in his sunglass wardrobe.  Well, Im in Colorado right now visiting my parents.  They flew Kris and I both in, and Kris was kind enough to bring both pairs to share with us.  Youll find us all modeling them below.  Please dont be jealous.  I know it must be heartbreaking to realize there will likely never be another pair quite like the Future Visions, or another homeless man offering quite the same pair (for 50 cents) in YOUR neck of the woods, but I hope these pictures will be enough to bring you at least some of the joy weve experienced here this week."

"Thankfuly, our Air conditioning got fixed on Friday last week. That helped a lot. Having all kinds of fun at work with Web Services.   That part was serious. Internet Explorer is the best browser for my site there.   That part was NOT serious.  We require our users to use Internet Explorer.  Being an admittedly big-time mozilla firebird (formerly phoenix) fan-boy, I was kinda ticked about that.  I was even more ticked when I found out how crappy IE can be to develop websites for. Since we're using ASP.NET, we are really pretty much stuck with IE as a client browser, since Microsoft's Technologies tend to play best when they play together.  Unfortunately, MS's bastard child of a web browser doesn't play well with Cascading Style Sheets or PNG image files (you know, the standard way to format web pages, and the recommended Web Image format - according to the W3C).  CSS is horribly nasty in IE - but PNG is even worse.  See there's this thing called an alpha channel.  an alpha channel lets you determine how  transparent  or  opaque  an image is.  PNG's lets you specify it on a per pixel level, with varying levels of transparency across the image.   The only comparable popular graphic format we have on the web is GIF.  GIF's have only recently come out of a problem with the compression algorithm patent, which was a concern before.  But on top of that, the format is WAAY too dated.  You're limited to 256 colors, and the alpha support is really nothing more than an on/off switch for transparency - as in all or none.  So hey, PNG overcomes all those limitations, and they render great in every modern web browser, on every platform. Except for Internet Explorer on windows.  ya.  sucks...  even IE for Apple can render them properly.  Just not, you know, the biggest audience with the largest market share.  It can't quite do it.  So what's a web dev to do?   Hack it up. Seems there's a workaround using some direct X image style filter that ONLY works with IE, and isn't a real clean workaround.  But at least it does something  Sad sad day, that I'd be bitching about web design :(  on another note - the Game development is doing well, we're supposed to go code freeze for demo this weekend, we'll see if that happens.  I only really have one thing to work out now,  one last bard song implemenation.   We'll see if I can swing it in time or not..  I got 2.5 done this evening, even with changing the tire on my wife's car, and driving around town for a bit after I got off work to show her some places she's trying to scout out for employment.  This last bard song is a bit more complex than the others that I've done, but I shouldn't have much problem getting it done given an entire afternoon.  I'll post more details about everything once I get some more free time.  Phil."

"I tried to make a  urlLink Mama Tita's  bake-at-home pizza last night. It was not a success. But from bad experiences comes good judgement. I now know that you bake these things with the cardboard base still under the pizza - otherwise the pizza melts through the rack and gets all over the inside of your oven.  It was a disaster, melted and burning pizza everywhere inside my oven. I had a friend over last night to watch a movie and scan some documents, and we both just stared in dismay at the debacle within the oven. We both looked at the mess and said it was a waste, then reached down and started picking half-cooked toppings off the mess."
